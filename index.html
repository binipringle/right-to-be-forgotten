  <h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
  This paper looks at how European, California, and proposed New York law protect or seek to protect the right to be forgotten, and discusses differences between  protections available to residents of Europe, California and New York. In Europe, the right to be forgotten is a fundamental right protected by the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). A version of this right is protected under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). More expansive protection of the right to be forgotten has been proposed in New York through New York State Senate Assembly Bill A5323 (2017-2018 Legislative Session). This paper argues that the right to be forgotten should be protected, explains why California law does not go as far as European law in protecting this right, and questions whether the proposed New York law can guarantee more protections than California law in protecting our right to be forgotten.
