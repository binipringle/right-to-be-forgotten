I decided to craft my term paper for Technology and Law on a website rather than in a Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer document for two reasons. First, I have come to prefer reading on a screen. Second, I want to make sure my paper is accessible to all, and I find that accessibility is just as easy - if not easier - to achieve in a website as in a thought-for-paper document. Third, Microsoft Word's default format settings tend to manifest themselves unexpectedly when I'm nearly done with my work, cause me to waste time struggling with them, and get on my nerves. Last but not least, a website is a living document that can grow and change.
