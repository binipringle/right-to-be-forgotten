I decided to craft my term paper for Technology and Law on a website rather than in a Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer document for four reasons. First, I prefer reading on a screen. Second, I want to make sure my paper is accessible to all, and I find that accessibility is just as easy - if not easier - to achieve on a website as in a designed-to-be-printed-paper document. Third, in my experience Microsoft Word's default formatting tends to manifest itself unexpectedly and drive me nuts (LibreOffice Writer is so much like MS Word that I fear it, too, will suddenly upset my design). Last but not least, a website is a living document that has the potential to grow and change.
