Biggest mistake students make when doing a 403 analysis is they jump to prejudice. I should first explain why it’s probative, and then explain why its prejudicial. Prejudice must substantially outweigh the probative value.

## Process for doing problems and reading cases

- {:.indent-0}(1) What is the evidence at issue?
- {:.indent-0}(2) Which side offers it?
- {:.indent-0}(3) What is the evidence offered to prove? AKA Why is it being offered? (remember that one piece of evidence may be admitted for one thing and not for another)
- {:.indent-2}(a) If the problem doesn’t tell you, then ask:
- {:.indent-4}(i) What’s the cause of action, defense, credibility, and/or background issues
- {:.indent-4}(ii) Why would the proponent want to get this evidence admitted? To establish what specific fact conclusion?
- {:.indent-0}(4)Which FRE(s) is/are triggered? What are the elements? Any exceptions apply?
- {:.indent-2}(a)Have your elementized outline of the triggered FRE before you apply it.
- {:.indent-2}(b)Which specific element is triggered by the facts?
- {:.indent-0}(5)Articulate in one sentence the rule/principle or concept that the problem is illustrating.

## Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause

Out-of-court statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted against criminal defendant must satisfy both the rules against hearsay and the confrontation clause.

- {:.indent-2}If yes, does it meet or fall within a hearsay exemption or exception?
- {:.indent-4}If no, stop analysis (statement does not come in).
- {:.indent-4}If yes, is the statement testimonial?
- {:.indent-6}If no, admit.
- {:.indent-6}If yes, is declarant available and subject to cross?
- {:.indent-8}If yes, admit.
- {:.indent-8}If no, was there prior opportunity to cross examine?
- {:.indent-9}If yes, admit.

**Davis primary purpose test**

Statements made in response to police interrogation are **non-testimonial** if circumstances objectively indicate that the **primary purpose of interrogation is to meet an ongoing emergency**. Statements made in response to police interrogation are **testimonial** when circumstances **objectively indicate** that there is **no ongoing emergency** and **the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past facts relevant to prosecution**. The primary purpose must be of both the defendant and the interrogator. The court must objectively consider all relevant circumstances including formality or informality of interrogation or questioning (ongoing emergency is only one factor).

**Factors to determine primary purpose**

- {:.indent-1}Declarant’s safety at time of statement
- {:.indent-1}Goal of questioning (resolve ongoing emergency or prosecution)
- {:.indent-1}Formality of statement (location, who speaking to, calm v fluid events)
- {:.indent-1}Description of past or current events
- {:.indent-1}Objective belief of declarant **and** interrogator

*Analyze circumstances/factors to support arguments on both sides.*

**Hearsay exceptions/exemptions that do not raise confrontation clause issues**

- {:.indent-1}Declarant-witness testifying about prior statements (because subject to cross) (801(d)(1))
- {:.indent-1}Opposing party statements used against defendant in a criminal case (because made by defendant) (801(d)(2))
- {:.indent-1}Opposing party co-conspirator statements (because in furtherance, not testimonial) (801(d)(2))
- {:.indent-1}Business records generally (purpose not prosecutorial; trustworthy)
- {:.indent-1}Dying declarations (because "founding era exception" to confrontation clause)
