> Individuals should have the right to "determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically stigmatized as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past." - Alessandro Mantelero, Professor of Law[^1]

The right to be forgotten is the right to have private information about a person removed from internet searches and other directories under some circumstances.[^2] This right urgently needs to be protected to preserve individual autonomy and enable equal opportunities for individual - hence collective - realization and growth. In Europe, the right to be forgotten is a fundamental right protected by the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). A version of this right is protected under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). More expansive protection of the right to be forgotten has been proposed in New York through New York State Senate Assembly Bill A5323 (2017-2018 Legislative Session). This paper will discuss how these three jurisdictions treat the right to be forgotten, explain why California law does not go as far as European law in protecting this right, and ask whether the proposed New York law can guarantee more protections than California law in protecting our right to be forgotten.
