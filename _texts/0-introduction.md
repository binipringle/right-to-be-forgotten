> Individuals should have the right to "determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically stigmatized as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past." - Alessandro Mantelero, Professor of Law[^1]

The right to be forgotten is the right to have private information about a person removed from internet searches and other directories under some circumstances.[^2] This right urgently needs to be protected to preserve individual autonomy and enable equal opportunities for individual - hence collective - realization and growth. In Europe, the right to be forgotten is a fundamental right protected by the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). A version of this right is protected under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). More expansive protection of the right to be forgotten has been proposed in New York through New York State Senate Assembly Bill A5323 (2017-2018 Legislative Session). This paper will discuss how these three jurisdictions treat the right to be forgotten, explain why California law does not go as far as European law in protecting this right, and explore whether the proposed New York law can guarantee more protections than California law in protecting our right to be forgotten.

## Origins

In Europe, the right to be forgotten is rooted in the belief that every person has the potential for rehabilitation and the idea that to become fully rehabilitated, individuals who were convicted of criminal offenses should be able to remove information about past convictions from search engines. The right to erase records of past action can be traced back to the United Kingdom's [Rehabilitation of Offenders Act of 1974](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/53), which is based on the idea that after a certain period of time many criminal convictions are "spent" and should be erased from search engines to avoid influencing potential employers, insurance companies, and landlords.[^3] French law similarly recognized the right to be forgotten by enacting *le droit à l’oubli*[^4] — the right to be forgotten - in 2010. The *droit à l’oubli* gives a person formerly convicted of a criminal offense who has served their time the right to object to publication of the facts of their conviction and incarceration. Thus, the right to be forgotten is premised on the potential for rehabilitation and the idea that formerly convicted individuals should be allowed to fully evolve without others digging up the digital memory of past transgressions.

The concept of the right to be forgotten or right to erasure is relatively new - it's largely a "digital-native" right, engendered by the internet - and taking shape as it transmutes. In recent years arguments in favor of this right have expanded to protect individuals from numerous harms caused by information published on the web, such as revenge porn sharing and photographs uploaded with poor judgment.

## Distinction between the right to be forgotten and the right to privacy

There is a lot of overlap between the right to be forgotten and the right to privacy because they both involve personal information published or publishable on the internet. At their core, however, these rights are distinct. The right to privacy concerns information that is not (or should not be) publicly known, while the right to be forgotten involves information that was publicly known. Thus, the right to be forgotten is not about privacy; instead, it is about the ownership of public information pertaining to oneself, and the right to have that information deleted or erased if such erasure does not conflict with the data controllers rights under law.

## Collision with other human rights

A claim by an individual that a search engine should delete public personal information raises issues of freedom of speech and freedom from censorship, both of which are fundamental human rights. Freedom of speech is recognized as a basic human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which states that "everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers." Similarly, freedom from censorship is a fundamental human right that is recognized by international law. Article 13 of the UDHR states that "everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion," including the right to "freedom to manifest [one's] religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance." Because censorship can interfere with an individual's right to freedom of thought and expression, and can limit the ability of individuals to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas, freedom from censorship is implied in the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Court-mandated deletion of an individual's public information can be construed as censorship (there is a good argument that only governments or state actors and not individuals can censor); law or court orders requiring search engines or data controllers to delete an individual's public information can be construed as an infringement upon the data controller's freedom of speech. In an attempt to resolve conflict between competing rights, European courts have established standards or tests that the information the individual seeks to have deleted must satisfy.   


## Standards

Because the right to be forgotten reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them, this fundamental right is "based on the autonomy of an individual becoming a rightholder in respect of personal information on a time scale; the longer the origin of the information goes back, the more likely personal interests prevail over public interests."[^7]

## Viability and implementation of the law

Writing in 2011 shortly before the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enshrined the right to privacy into European law, University of Zurich International Business Law Professor Rolf Weber compared the proposed right to be forgotten to a Pandora's Box.

[^7]:Weber, Rolf H. "The right to be forgotten: More than a Pandora's Box?" JIPITECH 120, 2011. [https://www.jipitec.eu/issues/jipitec-2-2-2011/3084/jipitec%202%20-%20a%20-%20weber.pdf](https://www.jipitec.eu/issues/jipitec-2-2-2011/3084/jipitec%202%20-%20a%20-%20weber.pdf)

## Fundamental right or international human right?

There has been controversy about the practicality of establishing a right to be forgotten (in respect to access of information) as an international human right. This is partly due to the vagueness of current rulings attempting to implement such a right.[10] Furthermore, there are concerns about its impact on the right to freedom of expression, its interaction with the right to privacy, and whether creating a right to be forgotten would decrease the quality of the Internet through censorship and the rewriting of history.[11] Those in favor of the right to be forgotten cite its necessity due to issues such as revenge porn sites appearing in search engine listings for a person's name, as well as instances of these results referencing petty crimes individuals may have committed in the past. The central concern lies in the potentially undue influence that such results may exert upon a person's online reputation almost indefinitely if not removed.[12]

Limitations of application in a jurisdiction include the inability to require removal of information held by companies outside the jurisdiction. There is no global framework to allow individuals control over their online image. However, Professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, an expert from Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said that Google cannot escape compliance with the law of France implementing the decision of the European Court of Justice in 2014 on the right to be forgotten. Mayer-Schönberger said nations, including the US, had long maintained that their local laws have "extra-territorial effects".[13]

Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González (2014)

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25th, 2018.

California created privacy law modeled in part on GDPR. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became law in 2018.

In 2017-2018, New York proposed a bill that would create an act that would protect the right to be forgotten.

Like Europe, Argentina and the Philippines have passed laws that protect the right to be forgotten in certain circumstances. Argentina's Law No. 26,388 (2014) establishes the right of individuals to request the deletion, blocking, or anonymization of their personal data when they are no longer necessary, relevant, or accurate for the purposes for which they were collected, and requires data controllers to ensure the protection of personal data, including the obligation to obtain the consent of data subjects for the collection, use, and disclosure of their personal data. The Philippines' Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) gives individuals the right to request the correction or deletion of their personal data held by data controllers in certain circumstances. While Argentinian case law is mostly concerning claims from celebrities, Philippines proposed law references the GDPR's "irrelevant, not publicly useful" test.

[^5]:For example, in the wake of *Google v Spain*, which I discuss in the "Europe" section of this paper, a wave of lawsuits demanding data removal were brought before Argentina's court. 200 of these were lawsuits brought by celebrities (nearly all represented by the same lawyer) against Google and Yahoo search engines, where actresses, models and athletes demanded removal of Internet search results and links to photographs.
