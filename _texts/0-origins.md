> Individuals should have the right to "determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically stigmatized as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past." - Alessandro Mantelero, Professor of Law[^fn1]

In Europe, the intellectual roots of the right to be forgotten can be found in French law, which recognizes *le droit à l’oubli* — the right to be forgotten - a right that allows a person formerly convicted of a criminal offense who has served their time to object to the publication of the facts of their conviction and incarceration. The *droit à l’oubli* was enacted in French Law in 2010. Roots of the right to erase records of past actions can also be found in United Kingdom's Rehabilitation of Offenders Act of 1974 (based on the idea that after a certain period of time many criminal convictions are "spent", meaning that information about the conviction should not be considered when obtaining insurance or seeking employment). Thus, the right to be forgotten is premised on the potential for rehabilitation - the idea that privacy allows us to fully evolve as individuals because it prevents others from digging up the digital memory of our past transgressions.

In the United States, where the punitive carceral system is designed to oppress, third-party access to formerly incarcerated individuals' criminal legal records marks them for exclusion from opportunities to seek employment, housing, and participate in political processes. It brands them with a figurative scarlet letter (footnote saying what scarlet letter is). The principal justification for burdening individuals who have served time with the ongoing stigma of having been incarcerated is the argument that publication of someone’s criminal history is protected by the First Amendment. While the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly protect privacy, the U.S. Supreme Court found an implicit fundamental right to privacy in the Fourteenth Amendment and penumbras of other parts of the U.S. Constitution (see Griswold v Connecticut [1965] and other cases), which limit government intrusion into individuals' right to privacy. However, the U.S. Constitution only protects against state actors. Invasions of privacy by individuals - arguably including search engines - can only be remedied under previous court decisions.

Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González (2014)

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25th, 2018.

California created privacy law modeled in part on GDPR. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became law in 2018.

In 2017-2018, New York proposed a bill that would create an act that would protect the right to be forgotten.
