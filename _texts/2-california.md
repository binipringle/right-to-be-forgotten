## Rule 102 Purpose

Reach fair and just determinations; eliminate delay; develop evidence law.

---

## Rule 104 Preliminary Questions

The trial judge decides any preliminary question about whether a witness is qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible on its face. In so deciding, the judge is not bound by evidence rules, except those on privilege. The standard of proof for the judge is a **preponderance of the evidence**. A preponderance of the evidence is just enough evidence to make it more likely than not that the preliminary facts which support admission are true. The policy rationale behind this rule is that all relevant evidence should be admitted unless excluded by a rule or precedent. [^1]

*Court often excludes prejudicial evidence under 403 if there is another way to get facts in.*

When the relevance of evidence depends on whether a fact exists, proof must be introduced sufficient to support a finding that the fact does exist. *Triggers to fact does not exist could be objections or challenges that suggest fact does not exist (remember if good faith belief thing happened evidence can come in)*

[^1]:Dowling v. U.S. (1990) *illustrates preliminary questions (Rule 104)* (Dowling accused of robbing a bank wearing a ski mask; judge allowed prosecution to bring evidence that Dowling tried to rob a house two weeks later wearing a ski mask even though Dowling was acquitted in the house robbery where there was reasonable doubt [highest standard of proof] because a reasonable jury could still find by a preponderance of the evidence [more likely than not] that Dowling robbed the house)

---

## Rule 901a Authentication

Real evidence must be authenticated. To authenticate evidence, the proponent must show that the evidence they want to admit is what they say it is.

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

---

## Rule 105 Limiting Instructions

If the court admits evidence that is admissible for one purpose (or against one party) but not another, the trial judge **must**, if requested, restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. Rule 105 supposes that juries will follow instructions and the limiting instruction will therefore limit any unfair prejudice stemming from jury misuse.

*The non-proponent party would argue that a limiting instruction is prejudicial because it actually brings possible uses of the evidence to the jury's attention which they might not have thought of otherwise.*

## Rule 401 Relevance

Relevant evidence is admissible unless a statute or rules provide otherwise. Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. A fact of consequence is a fact that goes to prove or disprove an element of a claim, charge, defense, cause of action or theory of the case. This broad admissibility is to allow parties to bring in as much evidence as possible to help a jury or judge reach a fair and just determination. At the same time, Rule 401 supports efficiency by keeping the jury focused on relevant facts. [^2] [^3] [^4]

The fact which the evidence is offered to prove need not be in dispute. In other words, evidence is relevant even if it addresses a matter that the opponent concedes (stipulates). See *Old Chief v. United States*. [^5]

[^2]:U.S. v. Roger Stone (USDC for District of Columbia, 2019) *illustrates relevance (Rule 401)* (Movie clip from the Godfather is relevant to place defendant’s statements about Frank Panganeli in context by showing the jury the image that Stone intended to evoke in Person 2’s mind when he named Panganeli)

[^3]:Wielgus v. Ryobi Techs., Inc. (Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, 2012) *illustrates relevance (Rule 401)* (motion in limine to bar plaintiff from presenting video and in-court demonstrations of SawStop Technology on model not substantially similar to model that caused injury denied without prejudice because SawStop functions in the same manner on both models and the probative value of the demonstration could substantially outweigh the danger of any unfair prejudice)

[^4]:U.S. v. Boros (7th Cir. 2012) *illustrates relevance (Rule 401)* (admission of doctor's testimony about types of medications Boros sold over internet had minimal relevance and low probative value but trial court allowed because provided context for jury so it met the low bar for relevance)

[^5]: Old Chief v. United States 519 US 172, 177, 179 (1997) *illustrates relevance despite stipulation* (Johnny Lynn Old Chief offered to stipulate that he had been convicted of a felony because he didn't want the prosecutor to present this evidence, but the court held that the prosecutor didn't have to stipulate if they didn't want to and the evidence was relevant regardless)

---

## Rule 402 Admissibility of Relevant Evidence

Relevant evidence is admissible unless a statute or rules provide otherwise. Irrelevant evidence is inadmissible.

---

## Rule 403 Prejudice

Rule 403 allows the judge to exclude evidence they consider unfairly prejudicial. Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. Unfair prejudice is when evidence misleads a jury to make a decision on an improper ground and/or causes confusion, delay or waste of time. By allowing judges to counterbalance the broad admissibility of other rules, Rule 403 aims to ensure fairness and efficiency. [^6] [^7] [^8] [^9]

*Probative is dependent on what the evidence is being offered to prove and what rules limit the use for (e.g., 407, 408, 608)*

*Prejudice is always jury misuse (making a decision on improper ground); also affected by policy of rule (e.g., 408 juries overvalue settlements); character evidence generally overvalued and decisions made on character rather than event on day in question.*

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

[^6]:State v. Poe, 21 Utah 113 (1968) *illustrates prejudice (Rule 403)* (Trial court abused discretion in admitting gruesome colored slides from autopsy because identity and cause of death was already established with black and white photographs and color slides were only offered by prosecution to inflame and arouse the jury so that they would recommend the death sentence rather than life imprisonment; reversed and remanded because of abuse of discretion and "other doubtful aspects of the trial")

[^7]:Haley, v. Gross, McKee, and Ellis, 86 F.3d 630 (7th Cir. 1996) *illustrates prejudice (Rule 403)* (trial court did not abuse discretion by admitting photograph of burned cell with dead body of Haley's cellmate because while disturbing, its contents were highly relevant, and its very significant probative value was not substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice; nor did trial court abuse discretion by admitting photograph of Haley in hospital severely burned and with leg shackles because not prejudicial)

[^8]:Old Chief *illustrates prejudice (Rule 403)* (court reinforced general rule that parties can always present evidence even if other side is willing to stipulate to the evidence. But can also use 403 to say in a particular case the evidence should have been stipulated to because was unfairly prejudicial given the specific facts of the case.)

[^9]:U.S. v. Boros *illustrates prejudice (Rule 403)* (dry testimony of doctor barely relevant but relevant because charge is conspiracy to import controlled substances. Prosecutor’s mistake was to use it in summation and talk about how people could have had miscarriages, could have died, which doesn’t have anything to do with the charge. Court says evidence not very probative but very prejudicial because people dying, having miscarriages.)

---

## Rule 611 Control by the Court and Leading Questions

**Rule 611** provides that the court should reasonably control procedures for examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make procedures effective; (2) avoid wasting time; and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.

**Leading questions** can be asked in cross examination, but only about information that was provided in direct examination, or when a party calls a hostile witness, adverse party, or witness identified with an adverse party.

---

## Rule 607 Witness Impeachment  

Any party may attack a witness’s credibility. Witnesses can be impeached for **incompetency, bias, prior inconsistent statement** and **general character for untruthfulness**.

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

---

## Rules 601 602 603 Witness Competency

Every person is competent to be a witness unless the Federal Rules or, in a civil case, state law, provide otherwise. A witness must have personal knowledge of the matter they are testifying to. To have personal knowledge, a witness must be able to perceive events, take an oath, and remember events. The rules tilt strongly towards competency so as to include as much relevant evidence as possible.  [^10] [^11]

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

[^10]:Kemp v. Balboa 23 F.3d 211 (8th Cir. 1994) *illustrates witness competency (Rules 601, 602, 602)* (court did not allow prison nurse's testimony to prove that Kemp did not pick up epilepsy medication because nurse had no personal knowledge since her testimony was based only on review of Kemp's medical file)

[^11]:United States v. Kelly 436 F.3d 992 (8th Cir. 2006) *illustrates witness competency (Rules 601, 602, 602)* (Kelly did not raise the issue of competency at trial, so appellate court reviews district court's decision for plain error)

---  

## Bias

**Bias** is the relationship between a party and a witness which might lead the witness to slant their testimony in favor of or against a party. (U.S. v. Abel) [^12]. Bias is always non-collateral.

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

[^12]:United States v. Abel 469 U.S. 45 (1984) *illustrates bias* (Extrinsic evidence to show bias is Ehle’s testimony that Ehle, Mills and Abel [defendant accused of bank robbery] were members of a secret prison organization whose members took an oath to deny its existence and “lie, cheat, steal [and] kill” to protect each other. Evidence offered by prosecution to rebut Mills [defendant’s witness]’s testimony that prior to Ehle’s testimony incriminating Abel, Ehle had told Mills that he [Ehle] was going to testify falsely against Abel. Prosecution brings extrinsic evidence of membership in secret prison organization to demonstrate that Mills is potentially biased in favor of Abel.)

---

## Rule 613 Prior Inconsistent Statement

A witness can be impeached with a **prior inconsistent statement**. The impeaching party does not need to disclose the prior statement to the witness but, if requested, must disclose it to the other party’s attorney. The witness must be afforded an opportunity to explain or deny.  **Extrinsic evidence** of a prior inconsistent statement is inadmissible to prove a **collateral** matter but can be brought in to prove a **non-collateral matter**. **Extrinsic evidence** is any evidence other than testimony from the witness on the stand. A **collateral matter** is only relevant to impeachment. A **non-collateral matter** proves a fact of consequence other than impeachment.[^13] [^14] The purpose of this rule is to regulate the use of prior inconsistent statements to avoid distracting jurors with tangential information that could cause confusion or delay.

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

[^13]:United States v. Kelly 436 F.3d 992 (8th Cir. 2006) *illustrates prior inconsistent statement Rule 613(b)* (child's tape-recorded testimony admissible as prior inconsistent statement under Rule 613(b). Rule 613(b) only states that a witness be afforded the opportunity to explain; it does not require a witness to actually explain or deny the prior inconsistent statements. Here, the child had the opportunity to explain himself, and Kelly had the opportunity to cross-examine the child. Moreover, although Kelly complains that the tape-recorded statement was used for substantive purposes, there is no evidence it was introduced for anything but impeachment of the witness.)

[^14]:Taylor v. Cheddar's Casual Cafe, Inc. 2017 WL 157886 (W.D. La 2017)(unreported) *illustrates prior inconsistent statement Rule 613(b)* (evidence of Young’s alleged theft from Cheddar’s is inadmissible because Young neither charged with nor convicted of a crime based on this allegation and there is no other relevant purpose for the admission of this evidence.) (Young’s statements to Cheddar’s’ management and the two insurance adjusters after Taylor’s fall at the restaurant are  inadmissible as hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but nonetheless admissible for the purpose of impeachment by prior inconsistent statement.)

---

## Rule 608 Witness Impeachment for Character for Untruthfulness

*Start analysis by providing Rule 404(a)(1)*

**Rule 404(a)(1)** prohibits evidence of a person’s character or character trait to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with that character or trait. This is because character evidence is not particularly probative given that people do not always act according to "character," and propensity-based decisions would be unfairly prejudicial jury misuse.

**Rule 608** provides an exception to this rule by allowing a witness’s character for untruthfulness to come in for impeachment purposes by allowing **testimony about reputation and opinion** and, on cross-examination, **questions about specific prior conduct** to rebut opinion or reputation evidence based on good faith belief. **Extrinsic evidence** is **not admissible** to prove **specific instances of a witness’s conduct** to show character for truthfulness (except criminal convictions under Rule 609). Rule 608 is based on the idea that evidence of character for truthfulness has some relevance because it helps the jury determine witness credibility. [^15] [^16] [^17]  

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

[^15]:Renda v. King 347 F.3d 550 (3d Cir. 2003) *illustrates witness impeachment for character for untruthfulness (Rules 404a1, 608)* (district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of Trooper King's good character for truthfulness because Renda attacked King's character for truthfulness by arguing during her opening statement that the jury should not believe King not because of bias but because he was corrupt and improperly performed his official duties.)

[^16]:United States v. Jones, 763 F.2d 518, 522 (2d Cir. 1985) *illustrates witness impeachment for character for untruthfulness (Rules 404a1, 608)* (holding that attacks on a witness's character for truthfulness in opening statements may qualify under the "otherwise" portion of Rule 608(a)).

[^17]:United States v. Martinez 923 F.3d 806 (10th Cir. 2019) *illustrates witness impeachment for character for untruthfulness (Rules 404a1, 608)* (no abuse of discretion in district court’s exclusion of defendant’s character-for-truthfulness evidence; the clear purpose of the prosecutor’s cross-examination was challenge defendant's veracity with respect to a specific issue in the present case [his intent], not his general truthfulness. See  Kauz, 188 F.2d at 10 [“The mere fact that a witness is contradicted by other evidence in the case does not constitute an attack upon his reputation for truth and veracity"]. "If this be an attack on Defendant’s character for truthfulness, then such an attack occurs whenever the prosecution puts on evidence contrary to a witness’s account.")

---

## Rule 404a1 General Prohibition of Character Evidence

**Rule 404(a)(1)** prohibits evidence of a person’s character or character trait to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with that character or trait. This is because character evidence is not particularly probative given that people do not always act according to "character," and propensity-based decisions would be unfairly prejudicial jury misuse.

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

---

## Rule 404a2 The Mercy Rule

*Start analysis by providing Rule 404(a)(1)*

**Rule 404(a)(1)** prohibits evidence of a person’s character or character trait to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with that character or trait. This is because character evidence is not particularly probative given that people do not always act according to "character," and propensity-based decisions would be unfairly prejudicial jury misuse.

Under **Rule 404(a)(2)** or **the Mercy Rule**, a criminal defendant may offer evidence of pertinent character traits of the victim and/or the defendant. If the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may attack the evidence in cross examination and bring in evidence of an opposing character trait. The policy reason for this rule is that the accused may need a counterweight to the extensive investigative and prosecutorial resources of the government. **In a homicide case**, if the defendant is claiming self-defense, the prosecutor does not have to wait for the defendant to offer character evidence of the victim but can directly offer evidence of the victim’s trait of peacefulness.

## Rule 404b1 and 404b2 Other Crimes Wrongs or Acts

*Start analysis by providing Rule 404(a)(1)*

**Rule 404(a)** prohibits evidence of a person’s character or character trait to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with that character or trait. This is because character evidence is not particularly probative given that people do not always act according to "character," and propensity-based decisions would be unfairly prejudicial jury misuse.

Under **Rule 404(b)**, evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove propensity or character for committing similar acts. However, it may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving **motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident**.

For evidence of prior acts to be admissible, the evidence must be offered for a proper purpose; (2) be relevant to that purpose; (3) does not cause unfair prejudice; and (4) the court must, upon request, issue a limiting instruction to restrict the evidence to its proper scope. In a criminal case, the prosecution must provide written notice to the defendant,  stating the permitted purpose for which the evidence is being offered and the reasoning that supports the purpose. This rule regulates evidence of prior acts to prevent jury misuse for propensity purposes, which is why the evidence must also satisfy 401, 403 and 105.

## Rule 407 Subsequent Remedial Measures

Evidence of measures that would have made an earlier injury or harm less likely to occur are **not admissible** to prove **negligence, culpable conduct, defect, need for warning, or need for instructions.** It may be **admissible** for another purpose such as **impeachment** or, if disputed, to prove **ownership and/or control** or **feasibility**. Rule 407 aims to promote socially valuable activities by not discouraging defendants from making prompt repairs. The rule also aims to protect plaintiffs from prejudice that could arise from jury misuse, because even with a limiting instruction it can be difficult to explain how to apply evidence for impeachment or feasibility but not liability. The rule also comes from concern that evidence of a subsequent remedial measure will often fail the Rule 403 balancing test because evidence of a substantial remedial measure is often highly probative. [^18] [^19] [^20] [^21] [^22]   

If a subsequent remedial measure is offered for impeachment, courts use a narrower than usual definition of impeachment, looking at whether a specific statement was in direct conflict with the measure; whether the witness made an absolute declaration (e.g., "safest possible"); and/or whether the declarant was personally involved with implementing the measure.

*Because impeachment is narrower it's a good place to argue 403 because if evidence for impeachment only less probative; prejudice is jury learning about and misusing measure*.

*Party seeking to admit would argue that the exception to this rule is there specifically to let this kind of evidence in to impeach or to prove ownership and/or control or feasibility. Party seeking to exclude would argue that exception is narrow and here this would cause prejudice from jury misuse.*

Konnecranes, Inc. and Morris Material Handling, Inc., 2019 WL 3842072 (2019) *illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407)* (policies and procedures not admitted for impeachment purposes because defendants expect that plaintiffs will rely on these policies and procedures for “more than” impeachment purposes)

[^21]:Kelly v. Crown Equip. Co., 970 F.2d 1273, 1278 (3d Cir. 1992) *illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407)* (evidence of subsequent design changes inadmissible where expert testified that previous design was excellent and proper, not that it was the best or only possible design)

[^22]:Anderson v. Malloy, 700 F.2d 1208, 1211-12 (8th Cir.1983) *illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407)* (evidence of subsequent remedial measures admitted to impeach statements that defendants had done everything necessary for a secure motel and that chain locks and peep holes would not be successful, when defendants took additional security measures after incident and installed those devices).

## Rule 408 Compromise Offers and Negotiations

Evidence of compromise offers or negotiations about a claim are **not admissible** to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or contradiction. **Rule 408** promotes the socially valuable activity of settling disputes by protecting conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations and encouraging free and full discussion of ways to settle a dispute. Litigation does not need to have started but there must be an actual dispute or  difference of opinion. Factors to determine whether a statement occurred during compromise negotiations include whether an offer was unilateral or bilateral, concrete or vague, in response to another offer, litigation threatened, and if legal terminology was used. [^23] [^24] [^25] [^26]

*Party seeking to exclude would argue that this rule specifically protects statements made in negotiations for the purpose of settling disputes and must be applied only for that, or the policy reason of promoting socially valuable negotiations would be diluted. Party seeking to admit would argue that evidence shows bias and bias always non-collateral.*

[^26]:Steps of analysis: The question is whether the statements or conduct were intended to be part of the negotiations toward compromise. Look for: a clear dispute or disagreement communicated between parties > a clear intent to compromise (after dispute) > whether the offer was unilateral or bilateral > whether the offer was concrete or vague > whether the offer was in response to another offer > whether litigation was threatened or started > attorneys or formal negotiations > "legalese" > distinction between business discussions and legal negotiations.

## Rules 801 and 802 Hearsay

**Hearsay** is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. A statement is an assertion of fact and the declarant is the person who made the statement. Hearsay is prohibited because the declarant cannot be cross examined and the statement was not made under oath, which makes it unreliable. Hearsay is inadmissible unless an exception or exemption applies. [^27]

*All witnesses are declarants but declarants are witnesses only when they testify under oath at a trial or hearing.*

Joe 8 F.3d 1488 (10th Cir. 1993) *illustrates hearsay* (court determined that threat and rape statements made by deceased Julia Joe to her doctor were admissible under statement for medical diagnosis or treatment [appellate court found that narrow then-existing mental state exception did not allow statement about alleged perpetrator's identity] and were not precluded under Rule 404(b) crimes, wrongs and other acts, as they were being offered to show defendant's "specific intent")

---

## Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay

Exceptions to the rule against hearsay covered by the exam are present sense impression, excited utterance, state of mind, medical diagnosis or treatment, and business records. The exemptions are statement against interest, declarant witness prior statement and statement of opposing party including statement by co-conspirator.

---

## Rule 803 1 Present Sense Impression

A statement of a **present sense impression** is an exception to the rule against hearsay whether the declarant is available as a witness or not. A present sense impression is a statement describing or explaining an event or condition, made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it. Statements of present sense impression are highly reliable because the declarant was pretty much thinking aloud without planning beforehand what they are going to say.

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

---

## Rule 803 2 Excited Utterance

An **excited utterance** is an exception to the rule against hearsay whether the declarant is available as a witness or not. An excited utterance is a statement responsive to a startling event, made before the declarant had time to contrive or misrepresent, while under stress of excitement caused by the startling event, and about the startling event. Excited utterances are reliable because excitement doesn't allow declarant to think much about what they say.

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

---

## Rule 803 3 State of Mind

A statement of the declarant’s **then-existing state of mind** is an exception to the rule against hearsay whether the declarant is available as a witness or not. State of mind is the declarant's **then-existing state of mind** such as **motive, intent, or plan**, or sensory, or physical condition such as **fear, pain, or discomfort**. State of mind is not memory or belief unless it relates to the validity or terms of the declarant’s will. Statements of then-existing state of mind are highly reliable because the declarant was pretty much thinking aloud without planning beforehand what they are going to say.

## Rule 803 4 Medical Diagnosis or Treatment

A statement made **for medical diagnosis or treatment** is not excluded by the rule against hearsay regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness if the statement is made for seeking medical diagnosis or treatment; and describes medical history, symptoms, their inception, or their general cause. Statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment are reliable because it is in the declarant's self-interest to provide truthful information to doctors when seeking medical care. **Rule 803(4)**.

[Return to top](https://binipringle.github.io/evidence/texts/1-condensedoutline/)

---

## Rule 803 6 Business Records

The "**business records**” exception to hearsay provides that a record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis is not excluded by the rule against hearsay whether the declarant is available as a witness or not, if the record was (A) made at or near the time by someone with knowledge; (B) kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity; (C) made as part of a regular practice; (D) the witness is the custodian or qualified or there is a certification; and (E) the opposing party doesn't show a lack of trustworthiness. Business records are highly reliable because they are generally kept to run businesses. **Rule 803(6)**.

## Rule 805 Hearsay Within Hearsay

**Hearsay within hearsay** is not excluded by the rule against hearsay if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the rule.

## Rule 804 Hearsay Exceptions Requiring Declarant Unavailability Statement Against Interest

A declarant is an unavailable witness if (1) a privilege applies; (2) the declarant refuses to testify, (3) does not remember, (4) is dead or ill, or (5) is absent and could not be found. A declarant is not unavailable if the proponent caused the declarant’s unavailability in order to prevent them from testifying.

A **statement against interest** made by an unavailable witness is an exception to the rule against hearsay if it is a statement that a reasonable person would believe to be true because it is so contrary to the declarant’s interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the declarant’s claim or expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability that the declarant would not have said it otherwise and, if offered in a criminal case, is supported by corroborating indicia of trustworthiness.[^27] [^28]

[^27]:Hardin's taped conversations with Stone and Johnson (Hypo for class 24) *illustrates statement against interest exception to rule against hearsay* (if Hardin's statement used against Stone the statement is untrustworthy because Hardin was cooperating with prosecutors when he taped the conversation)

[^28]:United States v. Chang 999 F,3d 1059 (C.A. 7th 2021) *illustrates statement against interest exception to rule against hearsay* (Court barred Lola Chang's self-incriminating statements exculpating Ely Lao where they had been arrested in a car that broke down on the highway and cops found drugs and illegally modified guns in the car, because the court found her statements untrustworthy because either coerced [cops thought maybe partner abuse] or for affection [cops thought Chang and Lao were "culturally" married] and because other evidence contradicted what Chang said)

## Rule 801d1 Declarant Witness Prior Statement

A **declarant-witness’s prior statement** is exempt from the rule against hearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination and the prior statement (A) is inconsistent and was given under penalty of perjury at another procedure; (B) is consistent and is offered (i) to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant fabricated it, was under improper influence or had improper motive; or (ii) to rehabilitate the witness's credibility when attacked on another ground; or (C) identifies a person the declarant perceived earlier.

## Rule 801d2 Hearsay Exemption Statements by Opposing Party including Co-Conspirators

An **opposing party's statement** is an exemption to the rule against hearsay if it was made by the opposing party in their individual capacity or by their agent or employee within the scope of their relationship or duties, or if it was **made by the party’s co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.** Neither declarant nor conspiracy have to be charged. **The proponent must offer additional evidence** that a conspiracy existed and that the party and declarant were members of the conspiracy. A conspiracy is a joint venture or common plan. A conspiracy exists until the parties are arrested or collaborate with law enforcement, extricate themselves from the conspiracy, or the conspiracy completes its end. The rationale behind **Rule 801** is estoppel, not reliability. Estoppel is a judicial device that holds a party responsible for all statements they make and therefore "estops" them from objecting to their own statement on grounds that it is unreliable.  However, a declarant can always take the stand and explain.  [^29] [^30] [^31] [^32]

## Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause

The **Sixth Amendment** states that in all **criminal prosecutions**, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against them. Thus, out-of-court statements against a criminal defendant offered for the truth of the matter asserted are excluded unless the declarant testifies at trial or the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. The out-of-court statement must be **Testimonial**. A testimonial statement is a formal declaration or affirmation made to establish a fact that the declarant would reasonably expect to be used for criminal investigation or prosecution (*Crawford* (2004)[^33]).[^34] Statements are **non-testimonial** when the **primary purpose** of a police interrogation is to enable police assistancefor meeting an **ongoing emergency**. The primary purpose must be of both the defendant and the interrogator (*Davis* (2006)[^35]). [^36] The policy reason for this rule is to prevent abuses by the court like what happened to Sir Walter Raleigh.

**Davis primary purpose test**

To determine the primary purpose of a statement, courts consider the declarant’s safety when they made the statement; the goal of the questioning; the formality of the statement including location, who took the statement, and fluid or calm environment; whether the declarant described past or current events; and the objective belief of declarant **and** interrogator. [^37] [^38]

**Factors to determine primary purpose**

- {:.indent-1}Declarant’s safety at time of statement
- {:.indent-1}Goal of questioning and objective belief of declarant **and** interrogator.
- {:.indent-1}Formality of statement (location, who speaking to, calm v fluid events)
- {:.indent-1}Description of past or current events

*Analyze circumstances/factors to support arguments on both sides.*

**Hearsay exceptions/exemptions that do not raise confrontation clause issues**

- {:.indent-1}Declarant-witness testifying about prior statements (because subject to cross) (801(d)(1))
- {:.indent-1}Opposing party statements used against defendant in a criminal case (because made by defendant) (801(d)(2))
- {:.indent-1}Opposing party co-conspirator statements (because in furtherance, not testimonial) (801(d)(2))
- {:.indent-1}Business records generally (purpose not prosecutorial; trustworthy)
- {:.indent-1}Dying declarations (because "founding era exception" to confrontation clause)

**Lab or scientific reports are testimonial**

In *Bullcoming* (2011)[^39] and *Melendez Diaz* (2009)[^40] the Court ruled that laboratory reports or affidavits accompanying reports are testimonial because they are made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact in a criminal proceeding. Therefore, these records cannot be admitted unless the person who did the test takes the stand.

[^33]:Crawford v. Washington 541 US 36 (2004) *shifted application of confrontation clause* (unexamined testimonial ex parte statements against defendant is what the confrontation clause bars)

[^34]:Note that hearsay exceptions that require the declarant to take the stand do not raise confrontation clause issues because declarant can confront (see list above).

[^35]:Davis v. Washington 547 US 813 (2006) *narrowed application of confrontation clause* (hearsay statements made in 911 call asking for aid were not "testimonial" because they were seeking help, not made for a prosecutorial purpose)

[^36]:Since Davis, statements are only testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to criminal prosecution.

[^37]:Michigan v. Bryant 562 US 344 (2011) *narrowed application of Davis primary purpose test* (Covington wounded and dying in gas station parking lot, told police that Bryant shot him outside Bryant's house; police testimony inadmissible under confrontation clause because police asked questions for the purpose of catching Bryant, and there was no ongoing emergency because Covington had left the area where Bryant had shot him)

[^38]:People v. Clay 88 AD 3d 14 (NY App. Div. 2011) *illustrates dying declaration exception to confrontation clause* (dying victim's words in reply to police questioning were testimonial but were a dying declaration so admissible as an exception to the confrontation clause)

[^39]:Bullcoming v. New Mexico 564 US 647 (2011) *illustrates lab report testimonial for confrontation clause* (lab analyst who analyzed blood alcohol test taken under a search warrant was required to take the stand; second surrogate analyst could not testify in analyst's place)

[^40]:Melendez-Diaz v. Massachussetts 557 US 305 (2009) *illustrates lab report testimonial for confrontation clause* (police seized around 28 grams of cocaine from Walmart employee and sent for analysis; lab report testimonial so analyst required in court)
