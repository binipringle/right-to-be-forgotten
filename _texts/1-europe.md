## Rule 102 Purpose

Help jurors reach fair and just determinations, eliminate delay, and develop evidence law.

---

## Rule 104 Preliminary Questions

The trial judge decides preliminary questions and is not bound by evidence rules except those on privilege. The proponent of the evidence has the burden of proving that the fact they seek to introduce exists. The standard of proof for the judge is a **preponderance of the evidence**. A preponderance of the evidence is just enough evidence to make it more likely than not that the preliminary facts which support admission are true. The policy rationale is that all relevant evidence should be admitted unless excluded by a rule or precedent. [^1]

[^1]:Dowling v. U.S. (1990) *illustrates preliminary questions (Rule 104)* (Dowling accused of robbing a bank wearing a ski mask; judge allowed prosecution to bring evidence that Dowling tried to rob a house two weeks later wearing a ski mask even though Dowling was acquitted in the house robbery where there was reasonable doubt [highest standard of proof] because a reasonable jury could still find by a preponderance of the evidence [more likely than not] that Dowling robbed the house)

---

## Rule 901a Authentication

Evidence must be authenticated. To authenticate evidence, the proponent must show that the evidence they want to admit is what they say it is.

---

## Rule 105 Limiting Instructions

If the court admits evidence that is admissible for one purpose (or against one party) but not another, the trial judge **must**, if requested, restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. Rule 105 supposes that juries will follow instructions and aims to ensure that proceedings are fair.

---

## Rule 401 Relevance

Evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. A fact of consequence is a fact that goes to prove or disprove an element of a claim, charge, defense, cause of action or theory of the case. This broad admissibility is to allow parties to bring in as much evidence as possible to help a jury or judge reach a fair and just determination. At the same time, Rule 401 supports efficiency by keeping the jury focused on relevant facts. [^2] [^3] [^4]

[^2]:U.S. v. Roger Stone (USDC for District of Columbia, 2019) *illustrates relevance (Rule 401)* (Movie clip from the Godfather is relevant to place defendant’s statements about Frank Panganeli in context by showing the jury the image that Stone intended to evoke in Person 2’s mind when he named Panganeli)

[^3]:Wielgus v. Ryobi Techs., Inc. (Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, 2012) *illustrates relevance (Rule 401)* (motion in limine to bar plaintiff from presenting video and in-court demonstrations of SawStop Technology on model not substantially similar to model that caused injury denied without prejudice because SawStop functions in the same manner on both models and the probative value of the demonstration could substantially outweigh the danger of any unfair prejudice)

[^4]:U.S. v. Boros (7th Cir. 2012) *illustrates relevance (Rule 401)* (admission of doctor's testimony about types of medications Boros sold over internet had minimal relevance and low probative value but trial court allowed because provided context for jury so it met the low bar for relevance)

---

## Rule 402 Admissibility of Relevant Evidence

Relevant evidence is admissible unless a statute or rules provide otherwise. Irrelevant evidence is inadmissible.

---

## Rule 403 Prejudice

Under Rule 403 the judge **may** exclude evidence they consider unfairly prejudicial. Relevant evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. Unfair prejudice is when evidence misleads a jury to make a decision on an improper ground and/or causes confusion, delay or waste of time. By allowing judges to counterbalance the broad admissibility of evidence allowed by other rules, Rule 403 aims to make proceedings fair, minimize expense, and help the court reach a just determination. [^5] [^6] [^7] [^8]

[^5]:State v. Poe, 21 Utah 113 (1968) *illustrates prejudice (Rule 403)* (Trial court abused discretion in admitting gruesome colored slides from autopsy because identity and cause of death was already established with black and white photographs and color slides were only offered by prosecution to inflame and arouse the jury so that they would recommend the death sentence rather than life imprisonment; reversed and remanded because of abuse of discretion and "other doubtful aspects of the trial")

[^6]:Haley, v. Gross, McKee, and Ellis, 86 F.3d 630 (7th Cir. 1996) *illustrates prejudice (Rule 403)* (trial court did not abuse discretion by admitting photograph of burned cell with dead body of Haley's cellmate because while disturbing, its contents were highly relevant, and its very significant probative value was not substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice; nor did trial court abuse discretion by admitting photograph of Haley in hospital severely burned and with leg shackles because not prejudicial)

[^7]:Old Chief *illustrates prejudice (Rule 403)* (court reinforced general rule that parties can always present evidence even if other side is willing to stipulate to the evidence. But can also use 403 to say in a particular case the evidence should have been stipulated to because was unfairly prejudicial given the specific facts of the case.)

[^8]:U.S. v. Boros *illustrates prejudice (Rule 403)* (dry testimony of doctor barely relevant but relevant because charge is conspiracy to import controlled substances. Prosecutor’s mistake was to use it in summation and talk about how people could have had miscarriages, could have died, which doesn’t have anything to do with the charge. Court says evidence not very probative but very prejudicial because people dying, having miscarriages.)

## Rules 601 602 603 Witness Competency

Every person is competent to be a witness unless the Federal Rules, or, in a civil case, state law, provide otherwise. A witness may only testify to a matter if the witness has personal knowledge of that matter. To have personal knowledge, a witness must be able to (1) perceive the events they testify to, (2) understand and take an oath to tell the truth, and (3) remember the events they narrate. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may be the witness’s testimony itself. [^9] [^10]

[^9]:Kemp v. Balboa 23 F.3d 211 (8th Cir. 1994) *illustrates witness competency (Rules 601, 602, 602)* (court did not allow prison nurse's testimony to prove that Kemp did not pick up epilepsy medication because nurse had no personal knowledge since her testimony was based only on review of Kemp's medical file)

[^10]:United States v. Kelly 436 F.3d 992 (8th Cir. 2006) *illustrates witness competency (Rules 601, 602, 602)* (Kelly did not raise the issue of competency at trial, so appellate court reviews district court's decision for plain error)

---

## Rule 611 Control by the Court and Leading Questions

The court should reasonably control procedures for examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make procedures effective; (2) avoid wasting time; and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment. **Leading questions** can be asked in cross examination, but only about information that was provided in direct examination, or when a party calls a hostile witness, adverse party, or witness identified with an adverse party.

---

## Rule 607 Witness Impeachment  

Any party, including the party that called the witness, may attack a witness’s credibility. Witnesses can be impeached for **incompetency, bias, prior inconsistent statement** and **general character for untruthfulness**. **Extrinsic evidence** can sometimes be brought in to impeach. Extrinsic evidence is any evidence other than testimony from the witness on the stand. Extrinsic evidence can be **collateral** and **non-collateral**. A **collateral matter** is only relevant to impeachment. A **non-collateral matter** proves a fact of consequence other than impeachment.

---

## Rule 613 Prior Inconsistent Statement

When examining a witness about a prior statement, a party does not need to show or disclose the contents of the prior statement to the witness. However, if requested, they must show or disclose it to the adverse party’s attorney.

Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement **cannot** be brought in to prove a collateral matter (prohibited by 403 and 611). Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement **can** be brought in to prove a non-collateral matter (allowed by 613). If brought in, the witness must be given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement and the other party the opportunity to examine the witness about it, or if justice so requires. [^11] [^12]

[^11]:United States v. Kelly 436 F.3d 992 (8th Cir. 2006) *illustrates prior inconsistent statement Rule 613(b)* (child's tape-recorded testimony admissible as prior inconsistent statement under Rule 613(b). Rule 613(b) only states that a witness be afforded the opportunity to explain; it does not require a witness to actually explain or deny the prior inconsistent statements. Here, the child had the opportunity to explain himself, and Kelly had the opportunity to cross-examine the child. Moreover, although Kelly complains that the tape-recorded statement was used for substantive purposes, there is no evidence it was introduced for anything but impeachment of the witness.)

[^12]:Taylor v. Cheddar's Casual Cafe, Inc. 2017 WL 157886 (W.D. La 2017)(unreported) *illustrates prior inconsistent statement Rule 613(b)* (evidence of Young’s alleged theft from Cheddar’s is inadmissible because Young neither charged with nor convicted of a crime based on this allegation and there is no other relevant purpose for the admission of this evidence.) (Young’s statements to Cheddar’s’ management and the two insurance adjusters after Taylor’s fall at the restaurant are  inadmissible as hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but nonetheless admissible for the purpose of impeachment by prior inconsistent statement.)

---  

## Bias

**Bias** is the relationship between a party and a witness which might lead the witness to slant their testimony in favor of or against a party. Bias can be conscious or unconscious. (U.S. v. Abel) [^13]

[^13]:United States v. Abel 469 U.S. 45 (1984) *illustrates bias* (Extrinsic evidence to show bias is Ehle’s testimony that Ehle, Mills and Abel [defendant accused of bank robbery] were members of a secret prison organization whose members took an oath to deny its existence and “lie, cheat, steal [and] kill” to protect each other. Evidence offered by prosecution to rebut Mills [defendant’s witness]’s testimony that prior to Ehle’s testimony incriminating Abel, Ehle had told Mills that he [Ehle] was going to testify falsely against Abel. Prosecution brings extrinsic evidence of membership in secret prison organization to demonstrate that Mills is potentially biased in favor of Abel.)

---

## Rule 404a1 General Prohibition of Character Evidence

**Rule 404(a)(1)** prohibits evidence of a person’s character or character trait to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with that character or trait. The rationale is to focus the jury on actions, not "character," because (1) character evidence is not particularly probative given that people do not always act according to "character"; and (2) propensity-based decisions would be unfairly prejudicial jury misuse.

---

## Rule 404b1 and 404b2 Other Crimes Wrongs or Acts

Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove a person’s character for the purpose of showing that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with that character. However, it may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.

---

## Rule 608 Witness Impeachment for Character for Untruthfulness

*Start analysis by providing Rule 404(a)(1)*

Rule 404(a)(1) thus excludes most character evidence. **Rule 608** lets some character evidence back in by allowing **opinion or reputation evidence** and **inquiry into specific instances of conduct** during cross examination, to prove a witness’s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. [^14] [^15] [^16] Evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the witness’s character for truthfulness has been attacked.

**Extrinsic evidence** is **not admissible** to prove **specific instances of a witness’s conduct** in order to attack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness (except criminal convictions under Rule 609). However, the attorney may ask questions during cross-examination about specific instances of a witness’s conduct to prove character for truthfulness or untruthfulness (the attorney wants the jury to infer that because the witness has a character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, it is more or less likely that the witness’s current testimony is true or false).

[^14]:Renda v. King 347 F.3d 550 (3d Cir. 2003) *illustrates witness impeachment for character for untruthfulness (Rules 404a1, 608)* (district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of Trooper King's good character for truthfulness because Renda attacked King's character for truthfulness by arguing during her opening statement that the jury should not believe King not because of bias but because he was corrupt and improperly performed his official duties.)

[^15]:United States v. Jones, 763 F.2d 518, 522 (2d Cir. 1985) *illustrates witness impeachment for character for untruthfulness (Rules 404a1, 608)* (holding that attacks on a witness's character for truthfulness in opening statements may qualify under the "otherwise" portion of Rule 608(a)).

[^16]:United States v. Martinez 923 F.3d 806 (10th Cir. 2019) *illustrates witness impeachment for character for untruthfulness (Rules 404a1, 608)* (no abuse of discretion in district court’s exclusion of defendant’s character-for-truthfulness evidence; the clear purpose of the prosecutor’s cross-examination was challenge defendant's veracity with respect to a specific issue in the present case [his intent], not his general truthfulness. See  Kauz, 188 F.2d at 10 [“The mere fact that a witness is contradicted by other evidence in the case does not constitute an attack upon his reputation for truth and veracity"]. "If this be an attack on Defendant’s character for truthfulness, then such an attack occurs whenever the prosecution puts on evidence contrary to a witness’s account.")

---

## Rule 407 Subsequent Remedial Measures

**Rule 407** excludes relevant evidence in order to promote socially valuable activities or protect socially valuable relationships by (1) encouraging defendants to make repairs promptly without worrying about their effects on pending litigation, and (2) protecting plaintiffs from prejudice that could arise from the jury interpreting subsequent remedial measures as an admission of fault. Subsequent remedial measures are measures that would have made an earlier harm less likely to occur. Evidence of subsequent remedial measures is **not admissible** to prove negligence; culpable conduct; a defect in a product; or a need for a warning or instruction. Evidence of subsequent remedial measures is **admissible** when offered to prove ownership and/or control; feasibility of precautionary measures; and/or to impeach a witness. The court **may admit** evidence of a remedial measure **if the measure was taken by a third party**.

Rule 407 is based on specific concerns that limited or excluded evidence will often fail the Rule 403 balancing test. **Concerns about the evidence’s probative value** are that even when evidence is admissible under Rule 407 with a limiting instruction, it is still difficult to explain how to apply evidence for impeachment or feasibility but not liability. **Concern about unfair prejudice specific to admitting evidence of a subsequent remedial measure** is that if the evidence is admissible under Rule 407 but at the defendant's request the judge applies Rule 403 where prejudice has to substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence, Rule 403 will often not keep the evidence out because evidence of a substantial remedial measure is often highly probative. [^17] [^18] [^19] [^20] [^21]   

[^17]:Hunter-McLeod v. Dollar Gen., Eastern District of Pennsylvania 2014 U.S. District. LEXIS 129177, CIVIL ACTION NO. 13-3113 (E.D. Pennsylvania, 2014) *illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407)* (video surveillance footage showing store employee putting cardboard on the floor where plaintiff fell is inadmissible as evidence of subsequent remedial measures because it does not directly contradict employee's witness testimony.)

[^18]:Parents and Estate of John Hill v. Konnecranes, Inc. and Morris Material Handling, Inc., 2019 WL 3842072 (2019) *illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407)* (policies and procedures not admitted for impeachment purposes because defendants expect that plaintiffs will rely on these policies and procedures for “more than” impeachment purposes)

[^19]:Complaint of Consolidation Coal Co., 123 F.3d at 137 (3d Cir. 1997) *illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407)* (Evidence of subsequent remedial measures for impeachment purposes "must contradict the witness's testimony directly" to be admissible)

[^20]:Kelly v. Crown Equip. Co., 970 F.2d 1273, 1278 (3d Cir. 1992) *illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407)* (evidence of subsequent design changes inadmissible where expert testified that previous design was excellent and proper, not that it was the best or only possible design)

[^21]:Anderson v. Malloy, 700 F.2d 1208, 1211-12 (8th Cir.1983) *illustrates subsequent remedial measures (Rule 407)* (evidence of subsequent remedial measures admitted to impeach statements that defendants had done everything necessary for a secure motel and that chain locks and peep holes would not be successful, when defendants took additional security measures after incident and installed those devices).

## Rule 408 Compromise Offers and Negotiations

Evidence is **not admissible** to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction if it is evidence of (1) furnishing, promising, offering, accepting, promising to accept, or offering to accept a consideration to settle a claim; **and** (2) conduct or statements made during negotiations about the claim.

**Rule 408** promotes the socially valuable activity of settling disputes by protecting conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount. This rule is designed to encourage settlements by fostering free and full discussion of the issues and ensure that parties are not inhibited from making offers or statements while negotiating a settlement. Litigation does not need to have commenced for Rule 408 to apply, but there must be an actual dispute or a difference of opinion. Discussion of otherwise discoverable evidence at a settlement conference is not automatically protected by Rule 408 and other rules may apply. [^22] [^23] [^24] [^25]

[^22]:Weems v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 665 F.3d 958 (C.A 8th Cir. 2011) *illustrates compromise offers and negotiations (Rule 408)* (district court violated Rule 408 by admitting into evidence a separation agreement and related testimony and this error likely materially influenced the jury’s verdict)

[^23]:except statements made during negotiations with a government agency; these can be introduced in a subsequent criminal investigation. **This will not be tested on the final**.

[^24]:MCI Communs. Servs. v. Hagan, 641 F.3d 112 (5th Cir. 2011) *illustrates compromise offers and negotiations (Rule 408)* (testimony about phone call asking how much damaged cable would cost was not excluded under Rule 408 because there was not yet an actual dispute)

[^25]:Steps of analysis: The question is whether the statements or conduct were intended to be part of the negotiations toward compromise. Look for: a clear dispute or disagreement communicated between parties > a clear intent to compromise (after dispute) > whether the offer was unilateral or bilateral > whether the offer was concrete or vague > whether the offer was in response to another offer > whether litigation was threatened or started > attorneys or formal negotiations > "legalese" > distinction between business discussions and legal negotiations.

---

## Rule 404a2 The Mercy Rule

*Start analysis by providing Rule 404(a)(1)*

**Rule 404(a)(2)** or **the Mercy Rule** provides exceptions to Rule 404(a)(1) **in a criminal case**. These are (A) a defendant may offer evidence of the defendant’s pertinent trait and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may offer evidence to rebut it; (B) a defendant may offer evidence of an alleged victim’s pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may (i) offer evidence to rebut it; and (ii) offer evidence of the defendant’s same trait (this exception is subject to limitations in sex-offense cases); and (C) **in a homicide case**, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the alleged victim’s trait of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.

---

## Rule 405 Substantive Use of Character or Propensity Evidence

**Rules 404 and 405** specifically allow reputation, opinion and extrinsic evidence to prove character **when character is an element of the claim or defense**.

*Start analysis by providing Rule 404(a)(1). Then Provide Rule 608 and maybe Rule 404(a)(2) aka The Mercy Rule*.[^26]

When admissible, "character" or "character trait" may be proved by testimony about a person’s **reputation**, or **opinion** about the person's "character" (**Rule 405(a)**). When a person’s character or character trait is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, the character or trait may also be proved by **relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct** (**Rule 405(b)**). **When character evidence is an element, character can be proved in any way the rules provide, and there is no bar on extrinsic evidence.** Character evidence is an element in disputes about **child custody**, **defamation**, **negligent entrustment**, and **defense of entrapment**. The court can always rule on a **403 objection** to exclude character evidence.

*Unfair prejudice will generally be jury misuse or overvaluing of character evidence.*

In a **child custody** dispute, character evidence can be an essential element because a child's wellbeing can depend on the "character" of the custodial parent.  

In a **defamation** dispute, character evidence can be an essential element because libel or slander is a false statement about someone that harms their reputation so character for truthfulness is a defense.

In a **negligent entrustment** dispute, character evidence can be an essential element because the plaintiff alleges that the defendant was negligent in entrusting a dangerous instrument (e.g., a car, gun, fireworks, skill saw, etc.) to a third party who the defendant knew or had reason to know would misuse or be negligent in using the instrument. The character of the third party is what is at issue, and the question is whether their character was such that the defendant should have known not to allow them access to the dangerous instrument.

In a **defense of entrapment**, character evidence can be an essential element where (1) a government agent induced the defendant to commit a crime that (2) the defendant was not otherwise predisposed to commit.

[^26]:Full set of rules for Rule 405 analysis: Rule 404(a)(1) generally prohibits evidence of a person’s character or character trait to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait. The rationale is to focus the jury on particular actions of parties and not on their “character” because (1) people do not always act according to character making character evidence not particularly probative; and (2) the drafters of the rules do not want the jury to make propensity-based decisions as this would be unfairly prejudicial jury misuse. There are exceptions to this rule. One exception is Rule 608, which allows a witness’s character for untruthfulness to come in for impeachment purposes by allowing testimony about reputation and opinion, and questions about specific prior conduct on cross-examination, but allows no extrinsic evidence. Other exceptions are in Rule 404(a)(2) aka the Mercy Rule which provides that a defendant in a criminal case may offer evidence of the defendant’s pertinent trait and evidence of an alleged victim’s pertinent trait except if the alleged victim is an alleged sex-offense victim, and, in a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the alleged victim’s trait of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor. Rule 405 lays out methods of proving character. Under Rule 405(a), when evidence of a person’s character or character trait is admissible, the character or character trait may be proved by testimony about the person’s reputation or opinion about the person’s character. Under Rule 405(b), when a person’s character or character trait is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, the character or trait may also be proved by relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct. When character evidence is an element, character can be proved in any way the rules provide, and there is no bar on extrinsic evidence. Character evidence is an element in disputes about child custody26, defamation27, negligent entrustment28, and in the defense of entrapment29.The court can always rule on a Rule 403 objection and decide to exclude any character evidence (403 backstop). Unfair prejudice will generally be jury misuse or overvaluing of character evidence.

## Rules 801 and 802 Hearsay

**Hearsay** is an out-of-court statement made by a person offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Hearsay is prohibited because the declarant cannot be cross examined to test for mistake or clarity, and because the statement was not made under oath, which makes it unreliable. Hearsay is inadmissible unless an exception or exemption applies.

---

## Rule 803 Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay

A statement of a **present sense impression** is an exception to the rule against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness. A present sense impression is a statement describing or explaining an event or condition, made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it. **Rule 803(1)**.

A statement of an **excited utterance** is an exception to the rule against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness. An excited utterance is a statement relating to a startling event. (1) The event must be startling enough to cause nervous excitement; (2) the statement must be made before the declarant has had time to contrive or misrepresent; (3) the statement must be made while under stress of excitement; (4) and the statement must be about the startling event. Courts allow excited utterances because they are highly reliable as the declarant’s excited state does not allow the declarant to think much about what they say. **Rule 803(2)**.

A statement of the declarant’s **then-existing state of mind** is an exception to the rule against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness. State of mind is the declarant's **then-existing state of mind** (such as motive, intent, or plan) or emotional, sensory, or physical condition (such as mental feeling, pain, or bodily health). State of mind does not include a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the validity or terms of the declarant’s will. Courts allow statements of the declarant's then-existing state of mind because they are highly reliable as the declarant is pretty much thinking aloud without planning beforehand what they are going to say. **Rule 803(3)**.

A statement made **for medical diagnosis or treatment** is not excluded by the rule against hearsay regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness if the statement (A) is made for medical diagnosis or treatment; and (B) describes medical history, past or present symptoms or sensations, their inception, or their general cause. Statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment are reliable because it is in the declarant's self-interest to provide truthful information to doctors when seeking medical care. **Rule 803(4)**.

The "**business records**” exception to hearsay provides that a record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis is not excluded by the rule against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness, if (A) the record was made at or near the time by someone with knowledge or from information transmitted by someone with knowledge; (B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, organization, occupation, or calling, including not-for-profit; (C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity; (D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or by a certification[^31; and (E) the opponent does not show a lack of trustworthiness. Business records are highly reliable because they are generally kept to run businesses. **Rule 803(6)**.

---

## Rule 805 Hearsay Within Hearsay

**Hearsay within hearsay** is not excluded by the rule against hearsay if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the rule.

---

## Rule 804 Hearsay Exceptions Requiring Declarant Unavailability Statement Against Interest

A declarant is an unavailable witness if (1) a privilege applies; (2) the declarant refuses to testify, (3) does not remember, (4) is dead or ill, or (5) is absent and the proponent was unable to procure the declarant’s attendance or testimony in the case of a hearsay exception. A declarant is not an unavailable witness if the proponent caused the declarant’s unavailability to prevent the declarant from testifying.

Under **Rule 804(b)(3)**, if the declarant is unavailable as a witness, the rule against hearsay does not exclude a **statement against interest** that (A) a reasonable person in the declarant’s position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because it was so contrary to the declarant’s proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great a tendency to invalidate the declarant’s claim against someone else or to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability; **and** (B) is supported by **corroborating circumstances** that clearly indicate its trustworthiness **if offered in a criminal case**. [^27] [^28]

[^27]:Hardin's taped conversations with Stone and Johnson (Hypo for class 24) *illustrates statement against interest exception to rule against hearsay* (if Hardin's statement used against Stone the statement is untrustworthy because Hardin was cooperating with prosecutors when he taped the conversation [no idea whether I got this right])

[^28]:United States v. Chang 999 F,3d 1059 (C.A. 7th 2021) *illustrates statement against interest exception to rule against hearsay* (Court barred Lola Chang's self-incriminating statements exculpating Ely Lao where they had been arrested in a car that broke down on the highway and cops found drugs and illegally modified guns in the car, because the court found her statements untrustworthy because either coerced [cops thought maybe partner abuse] or for affection [cops thought Chang and Lao were "culturally" married] and because other evidence contradicted what Chang said)

## Rule 801d2 Hearsay Exemption Statements by Opposing Party including Co-Conspirators

An **opposing party's statement** is not hearsay if **made by the opposing party in an individual or representative capacity**, or **by the opposing party’s agent or employee** within the scope of that relationship or while it existed and within the scope of their duties. [^29] An opposing party's statement is not hearsay if it was **made by the party’s co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.** Neither declarant nor conspiracy have to be charged. **Proponent must offer additional evidence** that a conspiracy existed and that the party and declarant were members of the conspiracy. A conspiracy is broadly defined as a common plan or joint venture. Idle chatter or casual conversation about past events are not statements in furtherance of a conspiracy. [^30] [^31] [^32]

The rationale behind **Rule 801** is estoppel, not reliability. Estoppel is a judicial device that holds a party responsible for all statements they make and therefore "estops" them from objecting to their own statement on grounds that it is unreliable.  However, a declarant can always take the stand and explain.


[^29]:Baines v. Walgreen 863 F.3d 656 (7th Cir. 2007) *illustrates opposing party's statement made by agent or employee; also illustrates hearsay within hearsay* (Baines allowed to admit Martin's statement that Ruehs stated that Birch told Ruehs not to hire Baines because Martin was a Walgreen's employee and Ruehs was her supervisor and statements were within the scope of employment, and because innermost level of testimony [what Birch said to Ruehs] was not a statement but a command)

[^30]:Hardin's taped conversations with Stone and Johnson (Hypo for class 24) *illustrates statement of opposing party exception to rule against hearsay* (go back and look at rules and hypo because not getting this)

[^31]:Mahlandt (pp. 671-672) *illustrates statement of opposing party exception to rule against hearsay* (any statement made by opposing party is broadly construed; does not have to be incriminating or inculpatory; includes diaries, off-hand remarks, things said in anger, things the declarant does not have personal knowledge of, things the declarant is mistaken about)

[^32]:McDaniel (pp. 669-670) *illustrates statement of opposing party exception to rule against hearsay* (cannot admit own statement because no self serving)

## Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause

The **Sixth Amendment** states that in all **criminal prosecutions**, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him. In criminal trials, the confrontation clause is in tension when out-of-court statements are admitted against the defendant for the truth of the matter asserted because defendant is unable to cross examine (confront) the declarant.

The Court in *Crawford* (2004)[^33] ruled that the confrontation clause bars **Testimonial** statements against a criminal defendant unless the declarant testifies at trial or the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross examine the declarant. A testimonial statement is a formal declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing a fact which the declarant would reasonably expect to be used in a criminal investigation or prosecution. [^34] The court in *Davis* (2006)[^35] ruled that statements are **non-testimonial** when theprimary purpose of a police interrogation is to enable police  assistancefor meeting an ongoing emergency.[^36]

*Out-of-court statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted against criminal defendant must satisfy both the rules against hearsay and the confrontation clause.*

**Steps of analysis**

- {:.indent-0}Is the statement hearsay?
- {:.indent-2}If yes, does it meet or fall within a hearsay exemption or exception?
- {:.indent-4}If no, stop analysis (statement does not come in).
- {:.indent-4}If yes, is the statement testimonial?
- {:.indent-6}If no, admit.
- {:.indent-6}If yes, is declarant available and subject to cross?
- {:.indent-8}If yes, admit.
- {:.indent-8}If no, was there prior opportunity to cross examine?
- {:.indent-9}If yes, admit.
- {:.indent-9}If no, exclude.

**Davis primary purpose test**

Statements made in response to police interrogation are **non-testimonial** if circumstances objectively indicate that the **primary purpose of interrogation is to meet an ongoing emergency**. Statements made in response to police interrogation are **testimonial** when circumstances **objectively indicate** that there is **no ongoing emergency** and **the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past facts relevant to prosecution**. The primary purpose must be of both the defendant and the interrogator. The court must objectively consider all relevant circumstances including formality or informality of interrogation or questioning (ongoing emergency is only one factor). [^37] [^38]

**Factors to determine primary purpose**

- {:.indent-1}Declarant’s safety at time of statement
- {:.indent-1}Goal of questioning (resolve ongoing emergency or prosecution)
- {:.indent-1}Formality of statement (location, who speaking to, calm v fluid events)
- {:.indent-1}Description of past or current events
- {:.indent-1}Objective belief of declarant **and** interrogator

*Analyze circumstances/factors to support arguments on both sides.*

**Hearsay exceptions/exemptions that do not raise confrontation clause issues**

- {:.indent-1}Declarant-witness testifying about prior statements (because subject to cross) (801(d)(1))
- {:.indent-1}Opposing party statements used against defendant in a criminal case (because made by defendant) (801(d)(2))
- {:.indent-1}Opposing party co-conspirator statements (because in furtherance, not testimonial) (801(d)(2))
- {:.indent-1}Business records generally (purpose not prosecutorial; trustworthy)
- {:.indent-1}Dying declarations (because "founding era exception" to confrontation clause)

**Lab or scientific reports are testimonial**

In *Bullcoming* (2011)[^39] and *Melendez Diaz* (2009)[^40] the Court ruled that laboratory reports or affidavits accompanying reports are testimonial because they are made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact in a criminal proceeding. Therefore, these records cannot be admitted unless the person who did the test takes the stand.

[^33]:Crawford v. Washington 541 US 36 (2004) *shifted application of confrontation clause* (unexamined testimonial ex parte statements against defendant is what the confrontation clause bars)

[^34]:Hearsay exceptions that require the declarant to take the stand do not raise confrontation clause because declarant can confront (cross-examine). See list above.

[^35]:Davis v. Washington 547 US 813 (2006) *narrowed application of confrontation clause* (hearsay statements made in 911 call asking for aid were not "testimonial" because they were seeking help, not made for a prosecutorial purpose)

[^36]:Since Davis, statements are only testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to criminal prosecution.

[^37]:Michigan v. Bryant 562 US 344 (2011) *narrowed application of Davis primary purpose test* (Covington wounded and dying in gas station parking lot, told police that Bryant shot him outside Bryant's house; police testimony inadmissible under confrontation clause because police asked questions for the purpose of catching Bryant, and there was no ongoing emergency because Covington had left the area where Bryant had shot him)

[^38]:People v. Clay 88 AD 3d 14 (NY App. Div. 2011) *illustrates dying declaration exception to confrontation clause* (dying victim's words in reply to police questioning were testimonial but were a dying declaration so admissible as an exception to the confrontation clause)

[^39]:Bullcoming v. New Mexico 564 US 647 (2011) *illustrates lab report testimonial for confrontation clause* (lab analyst who analyzed blood alcohol test taken under a search warrant was required to take the stand; second surrogate analyst could not testify in analyst's place)

[^40]:Melendez-Diaz v. Massachussetts 557 US 305 (2009) *illustrates lab report testimonial for confrontation clause* (police seized around 28 grams of cocaine from Walmart employee and sent for analysis; lab report testimonial so analyst required in court)
