### Motion in limine

Any motion, whether made before or during trial, to exclude anticipated prejudicial evidence before the evidence is actually offered. Judges have broad discretion when ruling on motions in limine. "Evidentiary rulings should be deferred until trial so that questions of foundation, relevancy, and potential prejudice may be resolved in proper context ... because a court is almost always better situated during the actual trial to assess the value and utility of the evidence." U.S. v. Casarez.
