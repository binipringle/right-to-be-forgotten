The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), a state law which aims to protect California consumers from security breaches by giving them a lot of control over what businesses may do with their data. The CCPA includes a groundbreaking provision that gives California consumers the “right to deletion” of their data, essentially giving them a right to be forgotten. The California right to deletion is much more limited than the right to be forgotten afforded by the GDPR and shows how the U.S. Constitution stopped California lawmakers from taking things as far as Europe.  
Section 1798.105 (a) of the CCPA provides that “[a] consumer shall have the right to request that a business delete any personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer.” Under 1798.105 (b) and (c), businesses that collect personal information about consumers must inform consumers of their rights to request the deletion of their personal information, delete the consumer’s personal information from their records if so requested, and direct any service providers to delete the consumer’s personal information from their records too. their personal information if so requested. There are, however, some broad exceptions. Notably, a business or service provider is not required to delete personal information if that information is needed to “[e]xercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.” 1798.105 (d)(4).

The CCPA and the GDPR give individuals to the right to be forgotten for different reasons. The CCPA is designed to protect consumers. It was written and passed largely in response to Cambridge Analytica’s deceptive practices to harvest and sell tens of millions of social media users’ personal data.  The roots of the GDPR are the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights which was written in response to the holocaust. If we accept Whitman’s characterization of European privacy law as “an aspect of dignity” whose fundamental values are respect and honor, and American privacy law as “an aspect of liberty” whose fundamental values are property and free speech, it is not surprising that the right to be forgotten differs greatly from one side of the Atlantic to the other. The good news is that no matter what the original purpose of the CCPA was, it can be used by persons who were formerly convicted of crimes to erase records of those crimes from internet searches if the record of the conviction contains identifying information making it personal information. Under the CCPA, personal information is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked (directly or indirectly) with a particular consumer or household.
The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 proposed several changes to the CCPA.[^12] The Act, also known as 2020 California Proposition 24, expands existing data privacy laws by allowing consumers greater control of their personal data and establishing the California Privacy Protection Agency.[38] It passed, with a majority of voters approving the measure.[39]


## California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

State statue that protects privacy and consumer rights of residents of California

The CCPA is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, United States. The bill was passed by the California State Legislature and signed into law on June 28, 2018. The intentions of the Act are to provide California residents with the right to:

Know what personal data is being collected about them.
Know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.
    Say no to the sale of personal data.
    Access their personal data.
    Request a business to delete any personal information about a consumer collected from that consumer.[10]
    Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.

Key differences between CCPA and Europe's GDPR include scope and territorial reach, definitions related to protected information, levels of specificity, and an opt-out right for sales of personal information (CCPA has this while GDPR doesn't, but arguably protects personal data from being used for marketing purposes in other ways). CCPA differs in definition of personal information from GDPR as in some cases the CCPA only considers data that was provided by a consumer. The GDPR does not make that distinction and covers all personal data regardless of source. CCPA does not protect sensitive personal information if the information was manifestly made public by the data subject themselves. As such, the definition in GDPR is much broader than defined in the CCPA.

## California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA)

The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA), also known as Proposition 24, is a California ballot proposition that amends the CCPA. It was approved by a majority of voters after appearing on the ballot for the general election on November 3, 2020. This proposition expands California's consumer privacy law and builds upon the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) of 2018, which established a foundation for consumer privacy regulations.
