## I. Purpose

The purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence are to (1) help the jury reach a fair and just determination, (2) eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay, and (3) promote the development of evidence law. **Rule 102**.

---

## II. Authentication

**Rule 901(a)** requires that evidence be authenticated. To authenticate evidence, the proponent of evidence must produce evidence that shows that the evidence the proponent seeks to admit is really the evidence the proponent claims it to be.

### Types of evidence

**Oral testimony:**

- {:.indent-2}**Fact witnesses** are people who perceived facts related to the lawsuit and testify about those facts.
- {:.indent-2}**Expert witnesses** use specialized knowledge to interpret evidence or explain it to the jury.
- {:.indent-2}**Character witnesses** offer information about the "good" or "bad" character of a party or witness.

**Real evidence** is “any physical evidence that a party claims played a direct role in the controversy.”

**Documentary evidence** is any type of writing or recording of information.

**Demonstrative evidence** is an object that did not play a role in the disputed events. Charts, tables, pictures, maps and graphs are common types of demonstrative evidence.

**Stipulations** are when both parties agree on a fact. When they do, they can stipulate that the fact is true for the purposes of litigation.

**Judicial Notice**: “if a fact is indisputably true (…) the trial judge can take judicial notice of the fact.” The fact must be either “generally known” or “accurately and readily determined.” (p. 10)

**Circumstantial evidence** (FRE does not use this phrase) is “any evidence that requires the jury to make an inference connecting the evidence with a disputed fact.” Compare with direct evidence.

**Direct evidence** directly establishes a contested fact and requires no inferential bridge.

**Indirect evidence** requires more inferential leaps.

---

## III. Raising and resolving evidentiary objections

**Motion to suppress** is a pretrial motion that argues that the opposing party’s evidence was illegally obtained.

**Motion in limine** is a pretrial motion to exclude evidence. "The purpose of such motions is to perform a gatekeeping function and permit the trial judge to eliminate from further consideration evidentiary submissions that clearly ought not to be presented to the jury because they clearly would be inadmissible for any purpose. … The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating blanket inadmissibility." (Wielgus v. Ryobi Techs [table saw case])

**Objection** is made in trial to stop the other party from admitting evidence not allowed by the FRE. An objection is made before the evidence is admitted. If evidence is inadmissible but a party does not object in time and/or fails to state the specific ground of the objection, the evidence might be admitted.

**Motion to strike** is made in trial when an item of evidence not allowed by the FRE has already entered the record.  A motion to strike is a recourse a party uses when they weren’t fast enough to forestall objectionable evidence; if the motion to strike is granted, the judge tells the jury that the item is struck from the evidence and they should ignore.  

**Offer of proof**. If one party objects to the evidence they can make an offer of proof to show the judge what the evidence entails. *If the party doesn’t make the offer of proof, the party waives the right to object on appeal.* If the substance of the evidence is apparent from the context, the party doesn’t have to make an offer of proof. ( pp. 44-45)

---

## IV. Preserving Claims of Error

**Rule 103**. If there was an error in an evidentiary ruling, a party may claim error if the erroneous ruling affects a substantial right of the party **and**

- {:.indent-2}(I) if the ruling admits evidence, a party
- {:.indent-4}(A) timely objects or moves to strike; **and**
- {:.indent-4}(B) states the specific ground, unless it was apparent from the context; **or**
- {:.indent-2}(II) if the ruling excludes evidence, a party informs the court of its substance by an offer of proof, unless the substance was apparent from the context.

A **substantial right of a party** is affected when there is a reasonable probability that had the judge not made the error, the outcome of the trial would have been different.

**Plain error** is an error that is so egregious that a reasonable person would lose faith in the justice system. A court may take notice of a plain error affecting a substantial right, even if the claim of error was not properly preserved. **103(e).**

What triggers the difference standards of review - plain error and abuse of discretion - is whether objection was made in a timely and specific manner. If the objection was made in a timely and specific manner, the court applies abuse of discretion. If the objection was **not** made in a timely and specific manner, the court applies plain error.

- {:.indent-2}**U.S. v. Gomez-Norena (9th Cir. 1990)** (district court did not commit plain error by admitting the drug courier profile testimony for the limited purpose of providing the jury with background information).

- {:.indent-2}**U.S. v. Smalls (10th Cir. 2014)** (while incarcerated accused of murdering other incarcerated person, who had asthma, by smothering; raised four evidentiary objections; appellate court reviewed for abuse of discretion considering the record as a whole and found no plain error; "The plain error standard presents a heavy burden for an appellant" and "is to be used sparingly.")

To be successful on appeal, an appellant must convince the appellate court that the trial judge’s evidentiary determination was **both** (1) (a) abuse of discretion **or** (b) plain error, **and** (2) a substantial right was violated.

**Reversible error** is an error by a trial judge that affects a substantial right of a party.

**Harmless error** is when the error did not affect a substantial right because there was other evidence that supported the trial verdict.  

---

## V. Limiting Instructions

A **limiting instruction** is an instruction from the judge to the jury, telling the jury to disregard evidence for a specific purpose or against a party.

**Rule 105** provides that if the court admits evidence that is admissible for one purpose (or against one party) but not another, the court, on timely request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly. Such instructions are not always easy for juries to follow, but the courts need to suppose that juries will follow instructions. Relying on that supposition, Rule 105 aims to ensure that proceedings are fair.

---

## VI. Preliminary Questions

**Rule 104(a)** provides that the court must decide any preliminary question about whether a witness is qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible on its face. In so deciding, the court is not bound by evidence rules, except those on privilege. Whoever wants the evidence in has the burden of proof. (standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence).

**Rule 104(b)** provides that when the relevance of evidence depends on whether a fact exists, proof must be introduced sufficient to support a finding that the fact does exist.

- {:.indent-2}**Dowling v. U.S. (1990)** (Dowling accused of robbing bank wearing ski mask; judge allowed prosecution to bring evidence that Dowling tried to rob a house two weeks later wearing a ski mask even though Dowling was acquitted in the house robbery where there was reasonable doubt; however, a reasonable jury could still find by a preponderance of the evidence that Dowling robbed the house)

---

## VII. Relevance

**Rule 401** of the Federal Rules of Evidence states that evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than that fact would be without that evidence. A fact of consequence is a fact that goes to prove or disprove some part of an element of a claim, charge or defense, cause of action or theory of the case. The broad admissibility written into this rule is to allow parties to bring in as much evidence as possible so that a jury or judge can render a fair and just determination of the case. Relevance supports efficiency by keeping the jury focused on relevant facts.

- {:.indent-2}**Hitchcock v. Walsh hypo** (D crossed center line of highway, hitting P's car and seriously injuring P, who sued D for negligence claiming D drunk; D seeks to admit W testimony that D was sober 3 hours before accident; P argues 3 hours long time but court finds relevant because any tendency)

- {:.indent-2}**Walsh v. Hospital hypo** (Walsh sued hospital for medical malpractice where following car accident nurse gave him wrong medicine causing permanent paralysis; defendant's drunkenness was fact of consequence and W testimony relevant because any tendency)

- {:.indent-2}**U.S. v. Roger Stone (USDC for District of Columbia, 2019)** (Movie clip from the Godfather is relevant to place defendant’s statements about Frank Panganeli in context by showing the jury the image that Stone intended to evoke in Person 2’s mind when he named  Panganeli)

- {:.indent-2}**U.S. v. Boros (7th Cir. 2012)** (admission of doctor's testimony about type of medications Boros sold over internet was harmless error because minimal relevance, minimal probative value, and despite overtones of prejudice, excluding doctor's testimony would not have led an "average juror" to find that the evidence was "significantly less persuasive.")

- {:.indent-2}**Wielgus v. Ryobi Techs., Inc. (Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, 2012)** (motion in limine to bar plaintiff from presenting video and in-court demonstrations of SawStop Technology on model not substantially similar to model that caused injury denied without prejudice because SawStop functions in the same manner on both models and the probative value of the demonstration could substantially outweigh the danger of any unfair prejudice)

- {:.indent-2}**Hypo** Alan is accused of selling cocaine. Prosecutor offers evidence that Alan regularly uses marijuana. Prosecutor would say relevant because Alan is charged with selling an illegal drug, and use of an illegal drug – marijuana – has some tendency to show that Alan knows and handles drugs. Defense would argue that use of a drug is unlike selling a drug. Just because I eat food doesn’t mean I sell food. Furthermore, marijuana is very different from cocaine. Cocaine is a schedule II drug and marijuana is a schedule I drug. Marijuana is legal in some states and cocaine is illegal everywhere. Defendant could raise 403. Could say jury might think that a drug user could sell drugs.

- {:.indent-2}**Hypo** Greg (D) is accused of assaulting Alex. Prosecutor calls a psychic to the stand, who testifies that the day before the assault, she had a vision of the future in which she saw Alex stabbing Greg’s wife with a steak knife. D objects that not relevant under 401. The issue is whether the psychic's testimony is relevant.
- {:.indent-5}**Offer of proof:** Psychic testifies that greg visited her every week and has done so for the past 15 years, has always followed her advice and believed her visions, and that she related this vision to him the morning of the assault.
- {:.indent-5}**Relevance:** Prosecution would say Psychic's testimony is relevant because it could give Greg  motive. Although prosecutors don’t have to show motive, it is relevant because it ties it all together. Defense would say it’s not relevant because hearsay and because the inferential leap is too great. We are expected to infer Greg’s reaction to being told that Alex stabbed his wife is to assault the person who allegedly stabbed his wife.

- {:.indent-2}**Hypo** about swastika tattoo on neck

401 and 403 often play off each other.  

---

## VIII. Prejudice

If a judge finds that evidence is unfairly prejudicial, they may exclude it under **Rule 403**. Courts find that relevant evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence. Prejudice must be unfair. Unfair prejudice is when evidence will lead a jury to make a decision on an improper ground. Rule 403 provides judges with the means to counterbalance the broad admissibility of evidence that other rules allow so as to make proceedings fair, minimize expense, and help the court reach a just determination.

- {:.indent-2}**State v. Poe, 21 Utah 113 (1968)** (Trial court abused discretion in admitting gruesome colored slides from autopsy because identity and cause of death was already established with black and white photographs and color slides were only offered by prosecution to inflame and arouse the jury so that they would recommend the death sentence rather than life imprisonment; reversed and remanded because of abuse of discretion and "other doubtful aspects of the trial")

- {:.indent-2}**Haley, v. Gross, McKee, and Ellis, 86 F.3d 630 (7th Cir. 1996)** (trial court did not abuse discretion by admitting photograph of burned cell with dead body of Haley's cellmate because while disturbing, its contents were highly relevant, and its very significant probative value was not substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice; nor did trial court abuse discretion by admitting photograph of Haley in hospital severely burned and with leg shackles because not prejudicial)

- {:.indent-2}**Old Chief** (court reinforced general rule that parties can always present evidence even if other side willing to stipulate to the evidence. But can also use 403 to say in a particular case the evidence should have been stipulated to because was unfairly prejudicial given the specific facts of the case. Supreme court said yes on relevance (401) but no on 403. It's relevant, you get to present it, but jury is going to get really confused, so we will tell jury there is a felony and the felony is for a gun.)

- {:.indent-2}**U.S. v. Boros** (dry testimony of doctor barely relevant but relevant because charge is conspiracy to import controlled substances. Prosecutor’s mistake was to use it in summation and talk about how people could have had miscarriages, could have died, which doesn’t have anything to do with the charge. Court says evidence not very probative.
Court says evidence very prejudicial because people dying, having miscarriages.)

---

## IX. Witness Competency

**Rule 601** states that every person is competent to be a witness unless the Federal Rules, or, in a civil case, state law, provide otherwise. **Rule 602** limits Rule 601 by providing that a witness may testify to a matter only if the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may consist of the witness’s testimony. To have personal knowledge, a witness must (1) be able to perceive the events they are testifying to, (2) be able to understand and take an oath or affirmation that they will tell the truth (**Rule 603**), and (3) have memory (recall) of the events and the ability to narrate.

A judge cannot be a witness (Rule 605) and a member of the jury cannot be a witness in a case which they are sitting on the jury for (Rule 606).

**Bias** character witnesses - is that fair?

A **Leading question** can be asked in cross examination, but only about information that was provided in direct examination. You can also ask leading questions in redirect examination and recross examination but only about information provided in direct examination and cross examination (**Rule 611**).

- {:.indent-2}**Kemp v. Balboa 23 F.3d 211 (8th Cir. 1994)** (court did not allow prison nurse's testimony to prove that Kemp did not pick up epilepsy medication because nurse had no personal knowledge since her testimony was based only on review of Kemp's medical file)

- {:.indent-2}**United States v. Kelly 436 F.3d 992 (8th Cir. 2006)** (Kelly did not raise the issue of competency at trial, so appellate court reviews district court's decision for plain error)

---

## X. Witness Impeachment

Witnesses can be impeached for incompetency, bias, prior inconsistent statement and general character for untruthfulness. Sometimes, extrinsic evidence can be brought in to impeach. **Rules 607, 611, 613**.

**Extrinsic evidence** is any evidence other than testimony from the witness already on the stand.   

**Collateral and non-collateral**. Extrinsic evidence can be collateral or non-collateral. A collateral matter is relevant to the case solely because it impeaches a witness. A non-collateral matter proves a fact of consequence other than impeachment. Judges use their discretion under rules 403 and 611 to prohibit extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement on a purely collateral matter, but parties may present extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements related to non-collateral matters (Merritt 229).

---  

## Bias

“**Bias** is a term used in the ‘common law of evidence’ to describe the relationship between a party and a witness which might lead the witness to slant, unconsciously or otherwise, his testimony in favor of or against a party. Bias may be induced by a witness's like, dislike, or fear of a party, or by the witness's self-interest.” (U.S. v. Abel)

- {:.indent-2}**United States v. Abel 469 U.S. 45 (1984)** Extrinsic evidence to show bias is Ehle’s testimony that Ehle, Mills and Abel (defendant accused of bank robbery) were members of a secret prison organization whose members took an oath to deny its existence and “lie, cheat, steal [and] kill” to protect each other. This evidence is offered by the prosecution to rebut Mills (defendant’s witness)’s testimony that prior to Ehle’s testimony incriminating Abel, Ehle had told Mills that he (Ehle) was going to testify falsely against Abel. The prosecution brings the extrinsic evidence of membership in the secret prison organization to demonstrate that Mills is potentially biased in favor of Abel.

---

## Prior Inconsistent Statement

Under **Rule 613(b)**, extrinsic evidence of a witness’s prior inconsistent statement is admissible if the witness is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement and the other party is given the opportunity to examine the witness about it. Implicit in Rule 613 is that counsel can question a witness about inconsistencies.

| Witness’s | governing rule | question on cross | offer extrinsic evidence |
| Ability to perceive, recall, narrate | 601 | yes | yes |
| Ability to understand and take oath | 603 | yes	| yes |
| Personal knowledge  | 602	| yes	| yes |
| Bias | 611(b)	| yes	| yes |
| Prior Inconsistent Statements | 613	| yes	| yes |

I might want something else there

- {:.indent-2}**United States v. Kelly 436 F.3d 992 (8th Cir. 2006)** (child's tape-recorded testimony admissible as prior inconsistent statement under Rule 613(b). Rule 613(b) only states that a witness be afforded the opportunity to explain; it does not require a witness to actually explain or deny the prior inconsistent statements. Here, the child had the opportunity to explain himself, and Kelly had the opportunity to cross-examine the child. Moreover, although Kelly complains that the tape-recorded statement was used for substantive purposes, there is no evidence it was introduced for anything but impeachment of the witness.)

- {:.indent-2}**Taylor v. Cheddar's Casual Cafe, Inc. 2017 WL 157886 (W.D. La 2017)(unreported)** (evidence of Young’s alleged theft from Cheddar’s is inadmissible because Young neither charged with nor convicted of a crime based on this allegation and there is no other relevant purpose for the admission of this evidence.) (Young’s statements to Cheddar’s’ management and the two insurance adjusters after Taylor’s fall at the restaurant are  inadmissible as hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but nonetheless admissible for the purpose of impeachment by prior inconsistent statement.)

---

## Witness Impeachment for Character for Untruthfulness

**Rule 404(a)(1)** provides that evidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait. **Rule 404(a)** thus excludes most character evidence. **Rule 608** lets some character evidence back in by allowing inquiry into specific instances of conduct probative of the witness’s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, during cross-examination.

**Rule 608(a)** allows any party to offer opinion or reputation evidence to attack a fact witness’s character for truthfulness.

- {:.indent-2}**Renda v. King 347 F.3d 550 (3d Cir. 2003)** (district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of Trooper King's good character for truthfulness because Renda attacked King's character for truthfulness by arguing during her opening statement that the jury should not believe King not because of bias but because he was corrupt and improperly performed his official duties.)

- {:.indent-2}**United States v. Jones, 763 F.2d 518, 522 (2d Cir. 1985)** (holding that attacks on a witness's character for truthfulness in opening statements may qualify under the "otherwise" portion of Rule 608(a)).

**Rule 608(b)** allows the attorney during cross-examination to inquire into specific instances of a witness’s conduct to prove truthfulness or untruthfulness. When the attorney inquires into specific instances of a witness’s conduct under 608(b), they are attempting to get the jury to infer that because the witness has a character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, it is more or less likely that the witness’s testimony is true.

- {:.indent-2}**United States v. Martinez 923 F.3d 806 (10th Cir. 2019)** (no abuse of discretion in district court’s exclusion of defendant’s character-for-truthfulness evidence; the clear purpose of the prosecutor’s cross-examination was challenge defendant's veracity with respect to a specific issue in the present case (his intent), not his general truthfulness. See  Kauz, 188 F.2d at 10 [“The mere fact that a witness is contradicted by other evidence in the case does not constitute an attack upon his reputation for truth and veracity.”] If this be an attack on Defendant’s character for truthfulness, then such an attack occurs whenever the prosecution puts on evidence contrary to a witness’s account.)

---

## Witness Impeachment for Prior Convictions to Show Character for Untruthfulness

Under **Rule 609(a)(1)(A)**, evidence of convictions for crimes punishable by death or by imprisonment for more than one year must be admitted in a civil or criminal case in which the witness is a not a defendant. If the witness is a defendant in a criminal case, **Rule 609(a)(1)(B)** provides that evidence of convictions for crimes punishable by death or by imprisonment for more than one year must be admitted if the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to that defendant. The policy reason for 609(a)(1) is that “commission of a felony-grade offense bespeaks a willingness to disregard social norms, and therefore bears on the likelihood that a witness would testify truthfully.” (U.S. v. Barr citing Caldwell). In considering whether probativeness outweighs prejudice under Rule 609, courts use a special balancing test with five factors, which are
- {:.indent-2}(1) the impeachment value of the former crime (the kind of crime involved);
- {:.indent-2}(2) when the conviction occurred and subsequent criminality;
- {:.indent-2}(3) the similarity of between the prior crime and the charged one;
- {:.indent-2}(4) the importance of the defendant's testimony for presenting the case; and
- {:.indent-2}(5) the degree to which the defendant's credibility is central to the case.

**Rule 609(a)(1)(2)** states that any crime, regardless of the punishment, must be admitted if their establishment proved that the witness committed a dishonest act or false statement. A dishonest act is fraud, misrepresentation or theft. A misdemeanor involving a dishonest act that (a) was committed as adult and (b) for which conviction occurred ten years ago or less is automatically admitted. No balancing test applies.

**Rule 609(b)** puts a limit on using evidence of a conviction if more than 10 years have passed since the witness’s conviction or release from confinement for it, whichever is later. Evidence of the conviction is admissible only if:
- {:.indent-2}(1) its probative value, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect; and
- {:.indent-2}(2) the proponent gives an adverse party reasonable written notice of the intent to use it so that the party has a fair opportunity to contest its use.

If evidence is admitted under Rule 609, a party can still use **Rule 403** to argue that the probative value of the evidence to prove the witness’s general character for truthfulness or untruthfulness is substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.

- {:.indent-2}**United States v. Barr U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150864** (court allowed evidence of one of two prior felony convictions for drug dealing and did not permit the other. Allows one because [1] felony-grade offense relevant to credibility; [2] drug dealing not similar to current offense of illegal possession of a weapon so not prejudicial for similarity; [3] prior conviction not more than ten years old; and [4] defendant only relevant fact witness for defense so testimony is critical. Judge issued limiting instruction that jury only consider convictions for impeachment. Did not permit evidence of second conviction because second very similar drug felony cumulative of the first.)

- {:.indent-2}**United States v.Casarez 2018 WL 3340871 (D. Nevada 2018) (unreported)** (court allows evidence of prior convictions substantially similar to current charges for purpose of impeachment but instructs prosecution to refer to them as “felonies.” Denies defendant's motion to impeach victim for prior conviction because defendant failed to show that victim's impeachment would be more probative than prejudicial. Allows defendant to impeach witness for prior convictions because no reason to believe violates Rule 403.).

**Rule 609(d)** provides that evidence of a **juvenile adjudication** is admissible only if:
(1) it is offered in a criminal case;
(2) the adjudication was of a witness other than the defendant;
(3) an adult’s conviction for that offense would be admissible to attack the adult’s credibility; and
(4) admitting the evidence is necessary to fairly determine guilt or innocence.

The policy reason for this rule is that the law promotes the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders by limiting disclosure of their convictions.

---

## XI. Subsequent Remedial Measures

**Rule 407** excludes relevant evidence in order to promote socially valuable activities or protect socially valuable relationships. These are (1) encouraging defendants to make repairs promptly without worrying about the effects of those repairs on pending litigation, and (2) protecting plaintiffs from prejudice that could arise from the jury interpreting subsequent remedial measures taken by the plaintiff as an admission of fault.

When measures are taken that would have made an earlier injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is

**not admissible** to prove:
- {:.indent-2}negligence;
- {:.indent-2}culpable conduct;
- {:.indent-2}a defect in a product or its design; or
- {:.indent-2}a need for a warning or instruction.

but **admissible** when offered for another purpose, such as:
- {:.indent-2}to to prove ownership and/or control;
- {:.indent-2}to to prove feasibility of precautionary measures; and/or
- {:.indent-2}to to impeach a witness.

The court **may admit** evidence of the remedial measure **if it was taken by a non-party.**

*A third party who makes a similar product or holds a similar event is completely outside of Rule 407 so you don't have to wait until the defendant denies feasibility to bring third-party evidence in.*

Rule 407 is also based on specific concerns that the evidence the rules limit or exclude will often fail the Rule 403 balancing test.
- {:.indent-2}**Concerns about the evidence’s probative value** are that even when evidence is admissible under Rule 407 with a limiting instruction, it can be difficult to explain to the jury how to apply the evidence for impeachment or feasibility but not for liability.
- {:.indent-2}**Concern about unfair prejudice specific to admitting evidence of a subsequent remedial measure** is that if the evidence is admissible under Rule 407 but the judge applies Rule 403 at the defendant’s request, the prejudice still has to substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence as required by Rule 403. Because a substantial remedial measure is often highly probative, Rule 403 will often not keep the evidence out.    

- {:.indent-2}**Hunter-McLeod v. Dollar Gen., Eastern District of Pennsylvania 2014 U.S. District. LEXIS 129177, CIVIL ACTION NO. 13-3113** (video surveillance footage showing store employee putting cardboard on the floor where plaintiff fell is inadmissible as evidence of subsequent remedial measures because it does not directly contradict employee's witness testimony.)

- {:.indent-2}**Emma HILL and William Hill as Parents of Michael John Hill, and Emmal Hill as Administratrix of the Estate of Michael John Hill v. Konnecranes, Inc. and Morris Material Handling, Inc., 2019 WL 3842072 (2019)** (policies and procedures not admitted for impeachment purposes because defendants expect that plaintiffs will rely on these policies and procedures for “more than” impeachment purposes.)

Evidence of subsequent remedial measures for impeachment purposes "must contradict the witness's testimony directly" to be admissible. Complaint of Consolidation Coal Co., 123 F.3d at 137; see e.g.,

- {:.indent-2}**Kelly v. Crown Equip. Co., 970 F.2d 1273, 1278 (3d Cir. 1992)** (evidence of subsequent design changes inadmissible where expert testified that previous design was excellent and proper, not that it was the best or only possible design)

- {:.indent-2}**Anderson v. Malloy, 700 F.2d 1208, 1211-12 (8th Cir.1983)** (evidence of subsequent remedial measures admitted to impeach statements that defendants had done everything necessary for a secure motel and that chain locks and peep holes would not be successful, when defendants took additional security measures after incident and installed those devices).

---

## XII. Compromise Offers and Negotiations

**Rule 408** promotes the socially valuable activity of settling disputes. Its purpose is to ensure that parties are not inhibited from making offers or statements during the settlement negotiation process.

**Rule 408(a)** states that the following evidence is **not admissible** to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction:
- {:.indent-2}(1) furnishing, promising, offering, accepting, promising to accept, or offering to accept a consideration to settle a claim; and
- {:.indent-2}(2) conduct or statements made during negotiations about the claim, except statements made during negotiations with government agency; these can be introduced in subsequent criminal investigation.

There must be a disputed claim for either offers of consideration or settlement negotiations (see language of 408(a)(2) – “the claim”). If there is no dispute about the amount or validity of a claim, there is no offer of consideration or settlement, and no negotiation.

**Rule 408(b)** provides the **exception** that the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as proving witness bias or prejudice or negating a claim of undue delay.


**Steps of analysis:** Look for:
- {:.indent-2}Clear dispute or disagreement communicated between parties
- {:.indent-2}Clear intent to compromise (after dispute)
- {:.indent-2}Whether offer is unilateral or bilateral
- {:.indent-2}Was offer concrete or vague
- {:.indent-2}Whether offer was in response to another offer
- {:.indent-2}Whether litigation threatened or started
- {:.indent-2}Attorneys or formal negotiations
- {:.indent-2}Legalese
- {:.indent-2}Difference between business discussions and legal negotiations

**Pre-existing discoverable evidence:** Discussion of otherwise discoverable evidence or witnesses at a settlement conference does not bring that evidence/witness within 408 protection. But not everything pre-existing is admissible (there are other rules that may apply). For example, *if a document is protected work product (even if it pre-dates the settlement negotiations) it is privileged and thus not discoverable or admissible.*

- {:.indent-2}**MCI Communs. Servs. v. Hagan, 641 F.3d 112 (5th Cir. 2011)** (testimony about phone call asking how much damaged cable would cost not excluded under Rule 408 because there was not yet an actual dispute)


- {:.indent-2}**Weems v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 665 F.3d 958 (C.A 8th Cir. 2011)** (district court violated Rule 408 by admitting into evidence a separation agreement and related testimony and this error likely materially influenced the jury’s verdict)

Rule 408 protects only conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount. This rule is designed to encourage settlements by fostering free and full discussion of the issues. The question under the rule is whether the statements or conduct were intended to be part of the negotiations toward compromise. Litigation does not need to have commenced for Rule 408 to apply, but there must be an actual dispute or a difference of opinion. MCI.

## XIII. Privileges

**Rule 501** provides two justifications for protecting otherwise relevant evidence through privilege: (1) to protect socially beneficial relationships and (2) to safeguard the inherent value of privacy as an end unto itself.

Rule 501 relegates privileges to common law (state law/federal common law). Rule 502 governs one aspect of the attorney-client privilege. Other rules were drafted but never enacted.

**Privileges protecting socially beneficial relationships:**
- {:.indent-2}Attorney-client /  work product for litigation
- {:.indent-2}Spousal adverse testimony / confidential marital communication
- {:.indent-2}5th amendment privilege against self-incrimination / applies in civil / criminal / pre-trial discovery
- {:.indent-2}Psychotherapist patient privilege – some licensed mental health social workers
- {:.indent-2}Clergy - penitent privilege (via federal common law)
- {:.indent-2}Trade secret (limited)

**Some states have privileges that cover:**
- {:.indent-2}Journalists
- {:.indent-2}Social workers – patient
- {:.indent-2}Accountant – client
- {:.indent-2}Doctor -  patient

*These are important because when State Law governs (diversity cases) state law on privilege governs and these privileges will apply.*

- {:.indent-0}**Steps of analysis for privilege:**
- {:.indent-5}What is the evidence
- {:.indent-5}What is it offered to prove
- {:.indent-5}Who holds it (who can waive and who must assert)
- {:.indent-5}When does it apply (what facts or circumstances support the privilege)
- {:.indent-5}What does it cover or shield (scope)
- {:.indent-5}Has there been a waiver
- {:.indent-5}Is the privilege absolute-ish or qualified and if qualified what is needed to pierce

## Attorney Client and Work Product

**Rule 502** provides that an attorney cannot be compelled to reveal confidential communication between client and counsel made in course of seeking legal advice/services/counsel (legal counsel) (5 C’s).
- {:.indent-2}Client holds privilege but attorney must assert it to protect client.
- {:.indent-2}Does not require anticipation of litigation – just seeking legal advice in confidence
- {:.indent-2}Does not cover ”things” or facts or communications to others; only communication to attorney in confidence – see examples 876 and 877 US v. Rhea p. 877-78
- {:.indent-2}Joint clients: only privileged as to outsiders and any one of clients can waive for all and force attorney to testify
- {:.indent-2}Does not protect communication with a client seeking assistance in committing a crime.
The policy reason for Rule 502 is protecting the socially beneficial attorney client relationship and general privacy.

### Waiver

It is client’s privilege to waive (even work product)

Inadvertent waiver: during discovery when otherwise protected information given to opposing counsel by mistake (e.g. sent over voluminous ESI data transfer) – potential to clawback and have opposing side which was inadvertently given the privileged material not use it.

If waiver deemed intentional or negligent including if client shares the confidential communication with someone else is waived and once waived remains waived.

### Work product

Protects documents and/or materials prepared by either attorney or client, including materials they request to be prepared, when prepared in anticipation (broadly construed) of litigation. Non-routinely prepared reports or documents that might be used in litigation must be prepared in anticipation of litigation.

**Work product privilege absolute-ish vs qualified privilege:**

| Absolute-ish | Qualified |
| Confidential communications between client and counsel for counsel (5C’s) | Facts about case developed through Attorney’s own investigation |
| Attorney’s notes that show thought process, legal research, planning, theories of case, etc. | Any documents prepared in anticipation of litigation  (broadly defined) by client (because work  product containing facts about dispute) |

**Qualified privilege may be obtained by opposing party if shows substantial need and undue hardship** (high bar, see UpJohn) (undue hardship might be if witness who testified for defense dies before can testify for prosecution).

- {:.indent-2}**Upjohn** (Corporate attorney-client privilege belongs to corporation and covers information provided by employees within the scope of their employment relationship)

- {:.indent-2}**Hedden v Kean University** (email from Sharp [university employee, witness for plaintiff] to Tripoli [defendant’s GC] not Sharp's to waive because attorney-client privilege did not belong to Sharp)

- {:.indent-2}**United States v. Lentz** (Lentz waived attorney-client privilege because knew calls from prison were being monitored)

## Spousal or Marital Privileges

The spousal or marital privilege is based on the policy rationale that disclosing confidential marital communications undermines the marital relationship and civilized society should not compel spouses to be the means of the other spouse’s conviction as long as married (but we can ask if they would like to help convict their spouse) plus general privacy.

The **marital communications privilege** covers information privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship . The marital communications privilege belongs to both spouses, so either spouse may invoke the privilege to avoid testifying or to prevent the other from testifying about the privileged communication. The marital communications privilege exists to ensure that spouses feel free to communicate their deepest feelings  to each other without fear of eventual exposure in a court of law. The marital communications privilege applies even after the marriage has dissolved, but the protected subject matter includes only what one spouse communicates to the other, not what one spouse learns about the other in other ways, such as by observing the other's actions.

The **spousal testimonial privilege** applies to any adverse testimony one spouse might provide as a witness against the other in a criminal case.  It is both broader and narrower than the marital communications privilege. It is broader in that it covers testimony on any adverse facts, no matter how they might have become known to the witness-spouse. It is narrower in that it applies **only to adverse testimony in a criminal case**, and it applies **only during the marriage**. Only the witness-spouse can invoke the privilege to refuse to testify adversely.

**Marital communication privilege vs spousal testimonial privilege:**

| Marital communication | Spousal testimonial |
| All judicial proceedings (criminal or civil) | Only applies in criminal proceedings |
| Confidential communication made during marriage when no one else can hear; Does not cover what spouse may have learned by observing | Covers any adverse facts regardless of how learned |
| Only covers what one spouse communicates to another during the marriage | Covers information learned prior to marriage |
| Applies after dissolution of marriage | Only applies during marriage |
| Privilege belongs to both spouses (both must agree to waive) | Only witness-spouse can invoke/waive |
| --- | Only applies to testimony (can be forced to provide finger prints, handwriting samples, etc.) |
| Exception for intra-family crimes | Exception for intra-family crimes |
| Exception for divorce and custody between spouses | --- |

- {:.indent-2}**United States v. Brock** (Ms. Brock waived marital communications privilege and spousal testimony privilege when during preliminary investigation she told police that she had seen husband handle weapons and shoot possums, and husband had asked her to move firearms from house to car)
