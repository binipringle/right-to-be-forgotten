In the United States, where the punitive carceral system is designed to oppress, third-party access to formerly incarcerated individuals' criminal legal records marks them for exclusion from opportunities to seek employment, housing, and participate in political processes. It brands them with a figurative scarlet letter.[^8] The principal justification for burdening individuals who have served time with the ongoing stigma of having been incarcerated is the argument that criminal history is public information and a search engine's right to freely publish public information about someoneâ€™s criminal history is protected by the First Amendment.

As stated earlier, there is considerable overlap between the right to privacy and the right to be forgotten. Here, they overlap because neither public nor private information, once published, can be removed from the internet. Even if criminal records become private records because they have been expunged or sealed, if they were published (even on a government website) they may still show up in search results on the web. If an individual claims that publication of information about expunged or sealed criminal records violates their right to privacy, a court will likely still not order a search engine to remove the information from the web because the implicit fundamental right to privacy in the Fourteenth Amendment and penumbras of other parts of the U.S. Constitution[^9] limits only government intrusion into individuals' right to privacy. Freedom from invasions of privacy by private actors - arguably including search engines - is not protected by the Constitution of the United States. There is an urgent need to amend privacy law in response to the wild proliferation of unregulated data merchants, and to enact law that protects the right to be forgotten so that we can do something about all the harmful data already out there on the internet.
