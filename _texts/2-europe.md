In “The Two Western Cultures of Privacy: Dignity Versus Liberty” (Yale Law Journal, 2004), law professor and scholar James Whitman wrote that privacy regulation in Continental Europe is derived from 17th and 18th century laws of honor and insult, originally settled by dueling.[^1] Whitman characterizes European privacy law as an aspect of dignity, whose two fundamental values are honor and respect.[^2] Center for Democracy and Technology Fellow Omer Tene noted that European privacy law was further shaped by lessons drawn from the horrors of World War II and the Communist era, when totalitarian regimes terrorized their citizens by decimating their right to privacy. Despite Europe's history of government intrusion, notes Tene, Europeans trust government more than the private sector with their personal data, and rely on regulatory protection for their privacy rights.[^4]

## European convention on Human Rights

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was signed in 1950, not long after the end of World War II, and enacted in 1953. Article 8 of the ECHR provides a right to respect for one's "private and family life, his home and his correspondence", subject to certain restrictions that are "in accordance with law" and "necessary in a democratic society".[^5]

## European data protective

In 1995, the European Union enacted the Data Protection Directive, officially Directive 95/46/EC ("Directive"), which regulated the processing of personal data within the European Union (EU) and the free movement of such data.[^6] The Directive broadly defined personal data as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person." In addition to a person's address, credit card number, bank statements, and other personal information, in the EU "personal data" includes a person's criminal record. The Directive defined "processing" as "any operation or set of operations [...] performed upon personal data." The Directive's premise was that personal data should not be processed at all unless it was processed for a legitimate purpose. The responsibility for compliance rested on the data controller. The Directive, however, was written before the expansion of the internet, and by the turn of the 21st century it had become clear that new legislation was needed. Before this legislation had been fully drafted, a ruling in a lawsuit brought before the Spanish Supreme Court created case law that established the right to have a data controller erase personal information under certain circumstances, and influenced how the right to be forgotten was codified in the new European law.

## Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González (2014)

Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González (2014) is a decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). It held that an Internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal information which appears on web pages published by third parties. The outcome of the ruling is that an Internet search engine must consider requests from individuals to remove links to freely accessible web pages resulting from a search on their name. Grounds for removal include cases where the search result(s) "appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in the light of the time that had elapsed."[5]: 92  If the search engine rejects the request, the individual may ask relevant authorities to consider the case. Under certain conditions, the search engine may be ordered to remove the links from search results.

GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation, adopted in April 2016, superseded the Data Protection Directive and became enforceable on 25 May 2018.[2]

## Viability and implementation of the law

Writing in 2011 shortly before the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enshrined the right to privacy into European law, University of Zurich International Business Law Professor Rolf Weber compared the proposed right to be forgotten to a Pandora's Box.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 17 Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)

The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: a. the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; b. the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; c. the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2); d. the personal data have been unlawfully processed; e. the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject; f. the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1).

Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.

Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:

a. for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; b. for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; c. for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3); d. for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or e. for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

## Google LLC v. CNIL, 2019 EUR-Lex CELEX No. 62017CJ0507 (Sept. 24, 2019)

On September 24, 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“the Court”) held that the “right to be forgotten” does not require a search engine to de-list search results on all of its domains. However, a search engine operator is still required to de-list search results on domains for all of the European Union (“EU”) Member States. The ruling left the referring court, the Conseil d’État (“the Conseil”), to apply the Court’s holding to Google’s practices in France.
