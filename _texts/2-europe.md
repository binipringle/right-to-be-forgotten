We have seen that the right to privacy and the right to be forgotten are distinct but overlap. Because the right to be forgotten grew out of privacy concerns, in this section we will look briefly at European privacy law and then go on to discuss how the right to be forgotten was established.

Privacy regulation in Continental Europe is derived from 17th and 18th century laws of honor and insult, originally settled by dueling, writes Yale Law Professor James Q Whitman.[^1] In “The Two Western Cultures of Privacy: Dignity Versus Liberty,” Whitman characterizes European privacy law as an aspect of dignity, where its two fundamental values are honor and respect.[^2] In the 20th century, European privacy law was shaped by lessons drawn from the horrors of World War II and the Communist era, notes Center for Democracy and Technology Fellow Omer Tene.[^3] Today, despite and because of Europe's history of government intrusion, many residents of Europe rely on regulatory protection of their privacy rights.

## **European Convention on Human Rights**

Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) ("Right to respect for private and family life") provides that "(1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence."[^4] The ECHR was signed in 1950, not long after the end of World War II, and enacted in 1953.

## **European Union Data Protection Directive**

In 1995, the European Union (EU) enacted the Data Protection Directive (Directive), which regulated the processing of personal data within the European Union (EU) and the free movement of such data.[^5] The Directive, which was replaced by the GDPR, broadly defines personal data as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” In addition to a person’s address, credit card number, bank statements, and other personal information, in the EU “personal data” includes a person’s criminal record. The Directive defines “processing” as “any operation or set of operations […] performed upon personal data.” The Directive’s premise was that personal data should not be processed at all unless it was processed for a legitimate purpose. The responsibility for compliance rested on the data controller. The Directive, however, was written before the expansion of the internet, and by the turn of the 21st century it was clear that new legislation was needed. Before it was fully drafted, a ruling in a lawsuit brought before the Spanish Supreme Court created case law that established the right to have a data controller erase personal information under certain circumstances, and influenced how the right to be forgotten came to be codified in European law.

## **Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González (2014)**

In *Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González* (2014), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that an internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing of personal information on web pages published by third parties and under certain circumstances must remove that information upon request.

The facts are as follows. In 1998 the Spanish newspaper *La Vanguardia* published a Boletin Oficial de Estado (official state bulletin) announcement in its online edition, informing the public that a property belonging to Mario Costeja González was going up for forced sale arising from social security debts. The announcement was published on the order of the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs to attract bidders to the auction, as provided by law. Eleven years later, in 2009, Costeja contacted *La Vanguardia* to complain that the announcement about the property sale and social security debt still came up in internet searches, and asked that the information be removed. *La Vanguardia* replied that it could not erase his data because it was an official announcement ordered by the government. Costeja asked Google Spain to remove links to the announcements. Google Spain forwarded Costeja's request to Google Inc., registered in California. Costeja filed a complaint with the Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (Spanish data protection agency) (AEPD). The AEPD rejected the complaint against the newspaper but upheld the complaint against Google Spain and Google Inc. pursuant to the EU Directive.

Google Spain and Google Inc. appealed before the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court of Spain). In their appeal, they argued that (1) Google Inc. was outside the scope of the  Directive and its subsidiary Google Spain was not responsible for the search engine; (2) there was no processing of personal data within the search function; (3) even if there were processing, neither Google Inc. nor Google Spain was a data controller; and (4) in any event, the data subject (Costeja) did not have the right to have lawfully published material erased. The Audiencia Nacional referred the case to the CJEU.

Because new points of law were involved, the CJEU sought the opinion of an Advocate General. Advocate General Niilo Jääskinen from Finland delivered his non-binding opinion in 2013, finding that (1) Google Inc. and Google Spain were within the scope of the Directive; (2) Google was not a data controller because processing was carried out in a haphazard, indiscriminate and random way; and (3) the rights of freedom of information and expression took precedence over the right to erasure. The Advocate General urged the court not to allow case-by-case resolution of this kind of conflict as these could lead to the "automatic withdrawal of links to any objected contents or to an unmanageable number of requests handled by the most popular and important Internet search engine service providers."[^6]

On May 13, 2014, the CJEU ruled that an internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties, upholding a right of erasure. The court found that Google was a data controller within the scope of the Directive (the court adopted a literal interpretation of the Directive's definition of “processing” as “any operation or set of operations […] performed upon personal data”). Regarding the territorial scope of the Directive, the court observed that Google Spain is a subsidiary of Google Inc. on Spanish territory and, therefore, an "establishment" within the meaning of the Directive. The court rejected Google Inc.'s argument that it was not processing data in Spain because promoting and selling advertising space by its subsidiary Google Spain was processing within the meaning of the Directive. The court thus endorsed the Advocate General's view that Google Inc. and Google Spain should be treated as a single economic unit.

The CJEU took into account Costeja's right to privacy deriving from articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFR).[^6]  The court further ruled that the Directive allows the data subject to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation.  The court found that Article 12(b) of the Directive, relating to the data subject's right of access to the data, allows the data subject to request erasure of data which "appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in the light of the time that had elapsed."[^8] The data does not have to be inaccurate and it is not necessary that the information be prejudicial to the data subject.

The ruling balances the right to privacy and data protection in European law with the legitimate interest of the public to access such information, and it does not mandate that information is instantly removed upon request. It distinguishes between public figures and private persons. The Court stressed that Internet search engines profile individuals in modern society in an ubiquitous manner, in a way that could not otherwise have been obtained formerly save only with the greatest difficulty. The data subject's rights must therefore in general override "as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in finding that information upon a search relating to the data subject's name."[^9] If, however, the data subject were a public figure, the public interest may outweigh the individual right.

Google removed the links to the newspaper article about Costeja, and subsequently published an online form which can be used by EU residents to request the removal of links. On the first day of the service, Google received over 12,000 requests from people asking Google to remove links about them from its search results.

## **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 17 Right to erasure ('right to be forgotten’)**

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25th, 2018. In Article 17 of the GDPR, the right to be forgotten is not actually called the right to be forgotten. It's called the "right to erasure ('right to be forgotten')." Article 17 provides that

> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: a. the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; b. the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; c. the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2); d. the personal data have been unlawfully processed; e. the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject; f. the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1).

> Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.

> Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary: a. for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; b. for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; c. for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3); d. for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or e. for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

This is very solid law. It took X years to draft the GDPR and many more years to create agencies and write regulations necessary for implementation of the law. While not all Europeans are happy with the law (my mother-in-law complains that she can't find anything out about people anymore), they are protected from the loss of autonomy that results from someone else owning and using one's personal data and related harms. Companies that want to earn money with data are not happy either, and the press push back a lot. Proponents of expanding protections as the internet expands continue to push too. For example, the Digital Services Act (DSA) is a new set of regulations proposed by the European Union that would require large online platforms to share more data with regulators, including information about their algorithms. Germany’s Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG) (2017) requires social media companies to remove illegal content within a certain timeframe, including content that promotes hate speech, terrorism, or other harmful behavior.

## **Google LLC v. CNIL (2019)**

On September 24, 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“the Court”) held that the “right to be forgotten” does not require a search engine to de-list search results on all of its domains. However, a search engine operator is still required to de-list search results on domains for all of the European Union (“EU”) Member States. The ruling left the referring court, the Conseil d’État (“the Conseil”), to apply the Court’s holding to Google’s practices in France. Google LLC v. CNIL, 2019 EUR-Lex CELEX No. 62017CJ0507 (2019)
