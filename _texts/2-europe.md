Privacy regulation in Continental Europe is derived from 17th and 18th century laws of honor and insult, originally settled by dueling, writes Yale Law Professor James Q Whitman.[^1] In “The Two Western Cultures of Privacy: Dignity Versus Liberty,” Whitman characterizes European privacy law as an aspect of dignity, where its two fundamental values are honor and respect.[^2] European privacy law is further shaped by lessons drawn from the horrors of World War II and the Communist era, notes Center for Democracy and Technology Fellow Omer Tene.[^3] Despite - or because of - Europe's history of government intrusion, many residents of Europe rely on regulatory protection of their privacy rights.

## **European Convention on Human Rights**

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was signed in 1950, not long after the end of World War II, and enacted in 1953. Article 8 of the ECHR provides a right to respect for one's "private and family life, his home and his correspondence", subject to certain restrictions that are "in accordance with law" and "necessary in a democratic society".[^4]

## **Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union**

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFR) enshrines political, social, and economic rights for EU citizens and residents into EU law. It was drafted and proclaimed in 2000 and came to have full legal effect with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009. Article 7 of the CFR ("Respect for private and family life") provides that "[e]veryone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications." Article 8 ("Protection of personal data") provides that (1) "[e]veryone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her; and (2) "[s]uch data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified."[^5]

## **European Union Data Protection Directive**

In 1995, the European Union (EU) enacted the Data Protection Directive, which regulated the processing of personal data within the European Union (EU).[^6] The Data Protection Directive broadly defined personal data as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person." In the EU "personal data" includes a person's criminal record. The directive's premise was that personal data should not be processed at all unless it was processed for a legitimate purpose. The responsibility for compliance rested on the data controller. The Data Protection Directive, however, was written before the expansion of the internet, and by the turn of the 21st century it was clear that new legislation was needed. Before it was fully drafted, a ruling in a lawsuit brought before the Spanish Supreme Court created case law that established the right to have a data controller erase personal information under certain circumstances, and influenced how the right to be forgotten was codified in the new European law.

In 1995, the European Union (EU) enacted the Data Protection Directive, officially Directive 95/46/EC (“Directive”), which regulated the processing of personal data within the European Union (EU) and the free movement of such data.6 The Directive broadly defined personal data as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” In addition to a person’s address, credit card number, bank statements, and other personal information, in the EU “personal data” includes a person’s criminal record. The Directive defined “processing” as “any operation or set of operations […] performed upon personal data.” The Directive’s premise was that personal data should not be processed at all unless it was processed for a legitimate purpose. The responsibility for compliance rested on the data controller. The Directive, however, was written before the expansion of the internet, and by the turn of the 21st century it had become clear that new legislation was needed.

## **Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González (2014)**

Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González (2014) is a decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). It held that an Internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal information which appears on web pages published by third parties. The outcome of the ruling is that an Internet search engine must consider requests from individuals to remove links to freely accessible web pages resulting from a search on their name. Grounds for removal include cases where the search result(s) "appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in the light of the time that had elapsed."[5]: 92  If the search engine rejects the request, the individual may ask relevant authorities to consider the case. Under certain conditions, the search engine may be ordered to remove the links from search results.

Adapted from Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González - Wikipedia

This is what happened. In 1998 the Spanish newspaper *La Vanguardia* published a *Boletin Oficial de Estado* (official state bulletin) announcement in its print and online editions, to inform the public that a property belonging to Mario Costejo González was going up for forced sale arising from social security debts. The announcements were published on the order of the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and their purpose was to attract as many bidders as possible. Mario Costeja González was named in the announcements. In 2009, Costeja contacted the newspaper to complain that when his name was enetered in the Google search engine, the announcement about the sale of his property including information about his long-paid social security debt was returned. Costeja asked that the data relating to him be removed, arguing that the forced sale was no longer relevant. The newspaper replied that erasing his data was not appropriate since the publication had been on the order of the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Costeja contacted Google Spain 2010, asking for the erasure of the links to the announcements. Google Spain forwarded the request to Google Inc., whose registered office is in California, United States. Costeja filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, AEPD) asking that (1) the newspaper remove the data, and (2) Google Spain or Google Inc. remove the links to the data. In 2010, the AEPD rejected the complaint against the newspaper but upheld the complaint against Google Spain and Google Inc., calling on them to remove the links complained of and make access to the data impossible.

Google Spain and Google Inc. subsequently brought separate actions against the decision before the Audiencia Nacional (National High Court of Spain). In their appeal, they argued that (1) Google Inc. was not within the scope of the EU Directive 95/46/EC (Data Protection Directive) and its subsidiary Google Spain was not responsible for the search engine; (2) there was no processing of personal data within the search function; (3) even were there processing, neither Google Inc. nor Google Spain could be regarded as a data controller; (4) in any event, the data subject (Costeja) did not have the right to the erasure of lawfully published material.

The Audiencia Nacional joined the actions and stayed the proceedings pending a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on a number of questions regarding the interpretation of the Data Protection Directive. These questions fell into three groups, which concerned (1) the territorial scope of the Directive; (2) the legal position of an Internet search engine service provider under the Directive, especially in terms of the Directive's material scope and as to whether the search engine could be regarded as a data controller; (3) whether the Directive establishes a so-called right to be forgotten.

These questions were new to the court. Because new points of law were involved, the opinion of an advocate general was sought. In 2013, the governments of Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain and Poland and the European Commission gave their opinion. Advocate General Niilo Jääskinen from Finland gave his non-binding opinion on 25 June 2013. On the first set of questions, the Advocate General found that Google's business model brought Google Inc. and Google Spain within the scope of the Directive. On the second set of questions concerning the material scope of the Directive, the Advocate General held that Google could not be regarded as a data controller because the processing was carried out in a haphazard, indiscriminate and random manner. In the advocate general's view the sense of the Directive was that "the controller is aware of the existence of a certain defined category of information amounting to personal data and the controller processes this data with some intention which relates to their processing as personal data." In the event that the court did not agree with his finding that Google was not a data controller, the Advocate General considered the third set of questions relating to a right to be forgotten. He held that the rights of freedom of information and expression took precedence over any such right to erasure, and urged the court not to allow case-by-case resolution of such conflicts as that would likely lead to the "automatic withdrawal of links to any objected contents or to an unmanageable number of requests handled by the most popular and important Internet search engine service providers."

On Date 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that an Internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties, upholding a right of erasure. The CJEU rejected Google's submission, supported by the Advocate General, that it could not be regarded as a data controller within the scope of the Data Protection Directive, adopting a literal interpretation of the Data Protecion Directive, which defined “processing” as “any operation or set of operations […] performed upon personal data.” Regarding the territorial scope of the Directive, the court observed that Google Spain is a subsidiary of Google Inc. on Spanish territory and, therefore, an 'establishment' within the meaning of the Directive. The court rejected Google Inc.'s argument that it was not carrying out its data processing in Spain, holding that the promotion and selling of advertising space by its subsidiary Google Spain was sufficient to constitute processing within the meaning of the directive. The court thus endorsed the Advocate General's view that Google Inc. and Google Spain should be treated as a single economic unit.[14]: 66–67 

Concerning the obligations and duties of the operator of a search engine, the court held that in the present case Article 7(f) of the directive, relating to legitimacy of processing, requires a balancing of the opposing rights and interests of the data subject (González) and the data controller (Google), taking into account the data subject's rights deriving from articles 7 (respect for private and family life) and 8 (protection of personal data) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  Article 14(a) of the Directive, relating to the data subject's rights, allows the data subject, at least in the cases covered by articles 7(e) and 7(f), to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation.  Article 12(b) of the directive, relating to the data subject's right of access to the data, allows the data subject to request erasure of the data. Such request may be made directly of the controller, who must then duly examine the merits of the request. If the request is not granted, the data subject may then direct the request to a supervisory authority or the judicial authority so that it carries out the necessary checks and orders the controller to take specific measures accordingly.

Regarding the question relating to the so-called right to be forgotten, the court noted that Google Spain, Google Inc., the Greek, Austrian and Polish governments and the European Commission considered that this question should be answered in the negative. The court held, however, that the processing of data which is "inadequate, irrelevant or excessive" (i.e. not merely inaccurate) might also be incompatible with the directive. In such cases, where the data is incompatible with the provisions of article 6(1)(e) to (f) of the directive, relating to data quality, the information and links in the list of the results must be erased. It is not necessary that the information is prejudicial to the data subject.

The ruling balances the right to privacy and data protection in European law with the legitimate interest of the public to access such information, and it does not mandate that information is instantly removed upon request. It distinguishes between public figures and private persons. The Court stressed that Internet search engines profile individuals in modern society in an ubiquitous manner, in a way that could not otherwise have been obtained formerly save only with the greatest difficulty. The data subject's rights must therefore in general override "as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in finding that information upon a search relating to the data subject's name", but that would not be the case if the role played by the data subject in public life is such "that the interference with his fundamental rights is justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question".

Google subsequently published an online form which can be used by EU citizens or EFTA nationals to request the removal of links from its search results if the data linked is "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed". On 31 May 2014, the first day of the service, Google received over 12,000 requests from people asking the company to remove certain links about them from its search results.[19]

On 19 June 2015, Google announced it would remove links to nonconsensual pornography ("revenge porn") on request. Commentators noted that this was not the same thing as implementing a "right to be forgotten" as the company already has policies in place dealing with sensitive personal data such as social security numbers and credit card numbers.[20] However, the consumer advocacy group Consumer Watchdog subsequently called on Google to extend the right to be forgotten to US users, filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.[21]

## Viability and implementation of the law

Writing in 2011 shortly before the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enshrined the right to privacy into European law, University of Zurich International Business Law Professor Rolf Weber compared the proposed right to be forgotten to a Pandora's Box.

## **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Article 17 Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)**

The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: a. the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; b. the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; c. the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2); d. the personal data have been unlawfully processed; e. the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject; f. the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1).

Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.

Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:

a. for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; b. for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; c. for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3); d. for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or e. for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

## **Google LLC v. CNIL (2019)**

On September 24, 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“the Court”) held that the “right to be forgotten” does not require a search engine to de-list search results on all of its domains. However, a search engine operator is still required to de-list search results on domains for all of the European Union (“EU”) Member States. The ruling left the referring court, the Conseil d’État (“the Conseil”), to apply the Court’s holding to Google’s practices in France. Google LLC v. CNIL, 2019 EUR-Lex CELEX No. 62017CJ0507 (2019)
